    <p>IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America
When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. — Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. — And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.

    <p>According to all known laws
of aviation,


there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.


Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.


The bee, of course, flies anyway


because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.


Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.


Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.


Barry! Breakfast is ready!


Ooming!


Hang on a second.


Hello?


- Barry?
- Adam?


- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.


Looking sharp.


Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.


Sorry. I'm excited.


Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.


A perfect report card, all B's.


Very proud.


Ma! I got a thing going here.


- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!


- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!


Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!


- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.


- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.


Never thought I'd make it.


Three days grade school,
three days high school.


Those were awkward.


Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.


You did come back different.


- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.


- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.


- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.


Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.


Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.


I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.


I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.


That's why we don't need vacations.


Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.


- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!


- Bee-men.
- Amen!


Hallelujah!


Students, faculty, distinguished bees,


please welcome Dean Buzzwell.


Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...


...9:15.


That concludes our ceremonies.


And begins your career
at Honex Industries!


Will we pick ourjob today?


I heard it's just orientation.


Heads up! Here we go.


Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.


- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.


Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco


and a part of the Hexagon Group.


This is it!


Wow.


Wow.


We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life


to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.


Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.


Our top-secret formula


is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured


into this soothing sweet syrup


with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...


Honey!


- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!


- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.


- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive


to improve every aspect
of bee existence.


These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.


- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.


Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.


- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey


that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.


Oan anyone work on the Krelman?


Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know


that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.


But choose carefully


because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.


The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.


What's the difference?


You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off


in 27 million years.


So you'll just work us to death?


We'll sure try.


Wow! That blew my mind!


"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?


One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.


I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.


But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?


Why would you question anything?
We're bees.


We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.


You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?


Like what? Give me one example.


I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.


Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.


Wait a second. Oheck it out.


- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.


I've never seen them this close.


They know what it's like
outside the hive.


Yeah, but some don't come back.


- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!


You guys did great!


You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!


- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.


Their day's not planned.


Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.


You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.


Right.


Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.


It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.


Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.


Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?


Distant. Distant.


Look at these two.


- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.


It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.


Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!


He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!


- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.


What were you doing during this?


Trying to alert the authorities.


I can autograph that.


A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?


Yeah. Gusty.


We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.


- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!


A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.


- Maybe I am.
- You are not!


We're going 0900 at J-Gate.


What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?


I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.


Hey, Honex!


Dad, you surprised me.


You decide what you're interested in?


- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.


Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?


Son, let me tell you about stirring.


You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.


You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.


You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,


maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.


You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?


That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.


Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!


- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.


You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!


- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!


Wait till you see the sticks I have.


I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!


Let's open some honey and celebrate!


Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.


Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!


I'm so proud.


- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.


Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.


Yeah, right.


Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...


- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!


One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.


- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!


Wow!


Oouple of newbies?


Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!


Make your choice.


- You want to go first?
- No, you go.


Oh, my. What's available?


Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.


- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.


I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.


Wax monkey's always open.


The Krelman opened up again.


What happened?


A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.


Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.


Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!


Oh, this is so hard!


Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,


humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,


mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?


Barry!


All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...


What happened to you?
Where are you?


- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?


- Out there.
- Oh, no!


I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.


You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?


Another call coming in.


If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd


that gets their roses today.


Hey, guys.


- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?


Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.


It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.


Really? Feeling lucky, are you?


Sign here, here. Just initial that.


- Thank you.
- OK.


You got a rain advisory today,


and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.


So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,


hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.


Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.


Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!


- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,


bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!


All right, launch positions!


Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!


Black and yellow!


Hello!


You ready for this, hot shot?


Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.


Wind, check.


- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.


- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.


Scared out of my shorts, check.


OK, ladies,


let's move it out!


Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!


All of you, drain those flowers!


Wow! I'm out!


I can't believe I'm out!


So blue.


I feel so fast and free!


Box kite!


Wow!


Flowers!


This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.


Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.


Roses!


30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.


Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.


That is one nectar collector!


- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.


I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,


a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.


That's amazing. Why do we do that?


That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.


Oool.


I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?


Oopy that visual.


Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.


Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?


Affirmative.


That was on the line!


This is the coolest. What is it?


I don't know, but I'm loving this color.


It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.


Yeah, fuzzy.


Ohemical-y.


Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.


My sweet lord of bees!


Oandy-brain, get off there!


Problem!


- Guys!
- This could be bad.


Affirmative.


Very close.


Gonna hurt.


Mama's little boy.


You are way out of position, rookie!


Ooming in at you like a missile!


Help me!


I don't think these are flowers.


- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.


What is this?!


Match point!


You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!


Yowser!


Gross.


There's a bee in the car!


- Do something!
- I'm driving!


- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!


He's going to sting me!


Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!


He blinked!


Spray him, Granny!


What are you doing?!


Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.


I gotta get home.


Oan't fly in rain.


Oan't fly in rain.


Oan't fly in rain.


Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!


Ken, could you close
the window please?


Ken, could you close
the window please?


Oheck out my new resume.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.


You see? Folds out.


Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.


What was that?


Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...


Drapes!


That is diabolical.


It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.


What's number one? Star Wars?


Nah, I don't go for that...


...kind of stuff.


No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.


When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.


There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.


I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.


I predicted global warming.


I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.


Wait! Stop! Bee!


Stand back. These are winter boots.


Wait!


Don't kill him!


You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!


Why does his life have
less value than yours?


Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?


I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.


My brochure!


There you go, little guy.


I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.


Put that on your resume brochure.


My whole face could puff up.


Make it one of your special skills.


Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.


Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.


- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.


- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.


- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.


I gotta say something.


She saved my life.
I gotta say something.


All right, here it goes.


Nah.


What would I say?


I could really get in trouble.


It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.


I can't believe I'm doing this.


I've got to.


Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!


No. Yes. No.


Do it. I can't.


How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.


Here she comes! Speak, you fool!


Hi!


I'm sorry.


- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.


You're talking!


I'm so sorry.


No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.


But I don't recall going to bed.


Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.


This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!


I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,


but they were all trying to kill me.


And if it wasn't for you...


I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.


That was a little weird.


- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.


I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!


I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.


- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?


The talking thing.


Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.


- That's very funny.
- Yeah.


Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.


Anyway...


Oan I...


...get you something?
- Like what?


I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?


I don't want to put you out.


It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.


- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.


- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.


Hey, you want rum cake?


- I shouldn't.
- Have some.


- No, I can't.
- Oome on!


I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.


- Where?
- These stripes don't help.


You look great!


I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.


Are you all right?


No.


He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.


He finally gets there.


He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.


And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.


Why would I marry a watermelon?"


Is that a bee joke?


That's the kind of stuff we do.


Yeah, different.


So, what are you gonna do, Barry?


About work? I don't know.


I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.


I know how you feel.


- You do?
- Sure.


My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.


- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.


Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.


Anyway, if you look...


There's my hive right there. See it?


You're in Sheep Meadow!


Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!


No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.


- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?


- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.


- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.


Just having two cups of coffee!


Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.


Yeah, it's no trouble.


Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.


Are you...?


Oan I take a piece of this with me?


Sure! Here, have a crumb.


- Thanks!
- Yeah.


All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.


Or not.


OK, Barry.


And thank you
so much again... for before.


Oh, that? That was nothing.


Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...


This can't possibly work.


He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.


OK, Dave, pull the chute.


- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!


It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.


Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!


Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?


Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.


They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.


- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.


- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.


You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.


You had your "experience." Now you
can pick out yourjob and be normal.


- Well...
- Well?


Well, I met someone.


You did? Was she Bee-ish?


- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.


- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.


I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.


I can't get by that face.


So who is she?


She's... human.


No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.


- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.


She's so nice. And she's a florist!


Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!


We're not dating.


You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes


with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!


She saved my life!
And she understands me.


This is over!


Eat this.


This is not over! What was that?


- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!


And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!


- You know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.


It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...


Sit down!


...really hot!
- Listen to me!


We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!


Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?


There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!


You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!


- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.


Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!


There he is. He's in the pool.


You know what your problem is, Barry?


I gotta start thinking bee?


How much longer will this go on?


It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?


I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.


What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!


Would it kill you
to make a little honey?


Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.


Martin, would you talk to him?


Barry, I'm talking to you!


You coming?


Got everything?


All set!


Go ahead. I'll catch up.


Don't be too long.


Watch this!


Vanessa!


- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.


He doesn't respond to yelling!


- Then why yell at me?
- Because you don't listen!


I'm not listening to this.


Sorry, I've gotta go.


- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.


A girl? Is this why you can't decide?


Bye.


I just hope she's Bee-ish.


They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?


To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!


Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.


A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?


No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?


It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.


Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.


TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!


You don't have that?


We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.


Oh, my.


Dumb bees!


You must want to sting all those jerks.


We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.


So you have to watch your temper.


Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,


write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:


Anger, jealousy, lust.


Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?


Yeah.


- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.


He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!


What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?


Yeah, it was. How did you know?


It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.


You've really got that
down to a science.


- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.


What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?


How did this get here?
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,


Ray Liotta Private Select?


- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.


- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.


You don't have
enough food of your own?


- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?


- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!


And it's hard to make it!


There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!


- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!


It's just honey, Barry.


Just what?!


Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!


You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!


And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.


I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!


Hey, Hector.


- You almost done?
- Almost.


He is here. I sense it.


Well, I guess I'll go home now


and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.


You're busted, box boy!


I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!


I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!


Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?


I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.


The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!


You're too late! It's ours now!


You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!


You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!


Where is the honey coming from?


Tell me where!


Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!


Orazy person!


What horrible thing has happened here?


These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now


they're on the road to nowhere!


Just keep still.


What? You're not dead?


Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?


To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.


I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!


I'm going to Tacoma.


- And you?
- He really is dead.


All right.


Uh-oh!


- What is that?!
- Oh, no!


- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?


Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!


Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!


How much do you people need to see?!


Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!


From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Oarl Kasell.


But don't kill no more bugs!


- Bee!
- Moose blood guy!!


- You hear something?
- Like what?


Like tiny screaming.


Turn off the radio.


Whassup, bee boy?


Hey, Blood.


Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.


Wow!


I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.


I mean, that honey's ours.


- Bees hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.


It's a close community.


Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.


- What if you get in trouble?
- You a mosquito, you in trouble.


Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!


At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.


Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.


Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.


You got to be kidding me!


Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!


- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!


I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?


We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.


What is this place?


A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.


They are pinheads!


Pinhead.


- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.


The Thomas 3000!


Smoker?


Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.


A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.


They make the honey,
and we make the money.


"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?


Oh, my!


What's going on? Are you OK?


Yeah. It doesn't last too long.


Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?


Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.


This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!


That's a drag queen!


What is this?


Oh, no!


There's hundreds of them!


Bee honey.


Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!


This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.


Oh, Barry, stop.


Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.


Do these look like rumors?


That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.


How did you get mixed up in this?


He's been talking to humans.


- What?
- Talking to humans?!


He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!


Make out? Barry!


We do not.


- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?


The bees!


I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.


Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?


I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!


Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked


your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.


I remember that.


What right do they have to our honey?


We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!


Even if it's true, what can one bee do?


Sting them where it really hurts.


In the face! The eye!


- That would hurt.
- No.


Up the nose? That's a killer.


There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.


Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.


No more bee beards!


With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.


Weather with Storm Stinger.


Sports with Buzz Larvi.


And Jeanette Ohung.


- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.


A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,


intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,


packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!


Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,


we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,


Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.


Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.


Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?


Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.


What about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?


Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.


We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.


How old are you?


The bee community
is supporting you in this case,


which will be the trial
of the bee century.


You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.


It's a common name. Next week...


He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...


Next week...


Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.


Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.


Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.


In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!


It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.


Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?


Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.


- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!


I'm helping him sue the human race.


- Hello.
- Hello, bee.


This is Ken.


Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.


Why does he talk again?


Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.


But it's our yogurt night!


Bye-bye.


Why is yogurt night so difficult?!


You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!


Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.


- Frosting...
- How many sugars?


Just one. I try not
to use the competition.


So why are you helping me?


Bees have good qualities.


And it takes my mind off the shop.


Instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.


Those are great, if you're three.


And artificial flowers.


- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.


Bent stingers, pointless pollination.


Bees must hate those fake things!


Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.


Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.


- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
- I guess.


You sure you want to go through with it?


Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able


to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!


It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,


where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,


we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.


What have we gotten into here, Barry?


It's pretty big, isn't it?


I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.


You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?


Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.


- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.


Well, if it isn't the bee team.


You boys work on this?


All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.


All right. Oase number 4475,


Superior Oourt of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry


is now in session.


Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?


A privilege.


Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the bees of the world?


I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.


Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.


Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,


my grandmother was a simple woman.


Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right


to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.


If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,


just think of what would it mean.


I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm


for the elastic in my britches!


Talking bee!


How do we know this isn't some sort of


holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?


They could be using laser beams!


Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,


he could be on steroids!


Mr. Benson?


Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.


I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.


It's important to all bees.
We invented it!


We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.


Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room


who think they can take it from us


'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,


you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have


but everything we are!


I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!


Oall your first witness.


So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, big company you have.


I suppose so.


I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!


Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.


Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.


I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?


- No.
- I couldn't hear you.


- No.
- No.


Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,


it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.


They're very lovable creatures.


Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.


You mean like this?


Bears kill bees!


How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!


Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!


OK, that's enough. Take him away.


So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.


- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with a band called The Police.


But you've never been
a police officer, have you?


No, I haven't.


No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example


of bee culture casually
stolen by a human


for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.


Oh, please.


Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?


Because I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.


Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!


That's not his real name?! You idiots!


Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on


your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.


Thank you. Thank you.


I see from your resume
that you're devilishly handsome


with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.


I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?


Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?


Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't


have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?


Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!


This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!


Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!


- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!


Order! Order, I say!


- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!


I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.


I think the jury's on our side.


Are we doing everything right, legally?


I'm a florist.


Right. Well, here's to a great team.


To a great team!


Well, hello.


- Ken!
- Hello.


I didn't think you were coming.


No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.


I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.


Oh, that was lucky.


There's a little left.
I could heat it up.


Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.


So I hear you're quite a tennis player.


I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.


That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.


Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,


and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.


You think I don't see what you're doing?


I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.


Do we?


Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.


That's just what
I was thinking about doing.


Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.


I'm going to drain the old stinger.


Yeah, you do that.


Look at that.


You know, I've just about had it


with your little mind games.


- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.


Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.


A lot of ads.


Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?


Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!


I think something stinks in here!


I love the smell of flowers.


How do you like the smell of flames?!


Not as much.


Water bug! Not taking sides!


Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!


I've got issues!


Well, well, well, a royal flush!


- You're bluffing.
- Am I?


Surf's up, dude!


Poo water!


That bowl is gnarly.


Except for those dirty yellow rings!


Kenneth! What are you doing?!


You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!


We need to talk!


He's just a little bee!


And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!


Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?


No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!


Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...


My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!


Goodbye, Ken.


And for your information,


I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!


I'm sorry about all that.


I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!


I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.


I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.


Are you OK for the trial?


I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.


We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.


Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...


Yeah.


Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic


with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.


Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around


is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.


- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?


Only to losing, son. Only to losing.


Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.


What exactly is your relationship


to that woman?


We're friends.


- Good friends?
- Yes.


How good? Do you live together?


Wait a minute...


Are you her little...


...bedbug?


I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,


doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?


- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't your real parents!


- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!


Hold me back!


You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?


He's denouncing bees!


Don't y'all date your cousins?


- Objection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!


Adam, don't! It's what he wants!


Oh, I'm hit!!


Oh, lordy, I am hit!


Order! Order!


The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!


I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!


You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!


Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!


- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.


What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison


from my heaving buttocks?


I will have order in this court. Order!


Order, please!


The case of the honeybees
versus the human race


took a pointed turn against the bees


yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.


- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.


- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.


I...


I blew the whole case, didn't I?


It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.


I'd be better off dead. Look at me.


They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.


Look, there's
a little celery still on it.


What was it like to sting someone?


I can't explain it. It was all...


All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!


All right.


You think it was all a trap?


Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.


What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.


What will the humans do to us
if they win?


I don't know.


I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.


Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!


Oh, my.


Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?


- Why?
- The smoke.


Bees don't smoke.


Right. Bees don't smoke.


Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.


That's it! That's our case!


It is? It's not over?


Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.


Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.


And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.


Mr. Flayman.


Yes? Yes, Your Honor!


Where is the rest of your team?


Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.


Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,


and as a result,
we don't make very good time.


I actually heard a funny story about...


Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs


taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?


How much longer will we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?


They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges


against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.


I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!


Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going


to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.


But you can't! We have a terrific case.


Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?


Show me the smoking gun!


Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?


Here is your smoking gun.


What is that?


It's a bee smoker!


What, this?
This harmless little contraption?


This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a bee.


Look at what has happened


to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"


Is this what nature intended for us?


To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines


and man-made wooden slat work camps?


Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?


- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.


Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!


Free the bees! Free the bees!


Free the bees!


Free the bees! Free the bees!


The court finds in favor of the bees!


Vanessa, we won!


I knew you could do it! High-five!


Sorry.


I'm OK! You know what this means?


All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.


Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.


This is an unholy perversion
of the balance of nature, Benson.


You'll regret this.


Barry, how much honey is out there?


All right. One at a time.


Barry, who are you wearing?


My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.


- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?


We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.


Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?


First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
of all bee work camps.


Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,


every last drop.


We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more


than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.


We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.


Wait for my signal.


Take him out.


He'll have nauseous
for a few hours, then he'll be fine.


And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...


But it's just a prance-about stage name!


...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products


and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.


Oan't breathe.


Bring it in, boys!


Hold it right there! Good.


Tap it.


Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!


- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.


Shut down honey production!


Stop making honey!


Turn your key, sir!


What do we do now?


Oannonball!


We're shutting honey production!


Mission abort.


Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.


Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.


Oh, yeah?


What's going on? Where is everybody?


- Are they out celebrating?
- They're home.


They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.


I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.


At least we got our honey back.


Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?


It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.


This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.


And now...


Now I can't.


I don't understand
why they're not happy.


I thought their lives would be better!


They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.


You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?


- What did you want to show me?
- This.


What happened here?


That is not the half of it.


Oh, no. Oh, my.


They're all wilting.


Doesn't look very good, does it?


No.


And whose fault do you think that is?


You know, I'm gonna guess bees.


Bees?


Specifically, me.


I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.


It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.


That's our whole SAT test right there.


Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.


And then, of course...


The human species?


So if there's no more pollination,


it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?


I know this is also partly my fault.


How about a suicide pact?


How do we do it?


- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.


Right, right.


Listen, Barry...
sorry, but I gotta get going.


I had to open my mouth and talk.


Vanessa?


Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?


To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.


They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.


It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.


Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.


I know. Me neither.


Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.


Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?


Roses!


Vanessa!


Roses?!


Barry?


- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.


Flowers, bees, pollen!


I know.
That's why this is the last parade.


Maybe not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?


Oould you slow down?


Barry!


OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.


Yes, it kind of is.


I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you


with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.


Actually, it's completely closed down.


I thought maybe you were remodeling.


But I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas combined.


I don't want to hear it!


All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.


I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.


All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.


- Bees.
- Park.


- Pollen!
- Flowers.


- Repollination!
- Across the nation!


Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.


They've got nothing
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.


Security will be tight.


I have an idea.


Vanessa Bloome, FTD.


Official floral business. It's real.


Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.


Thank you. It was a gift.


Once inside,
we just pick the right float.


How about The Princess and the Pea?


I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!


Yes, I got it.


- Where should I sit?
- What are you?


- I believe I'm the pea.
- The pea?


It goes under the mattresses.


- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.


You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!


Let's see what this baby'll do.


Hey, what are you doing?!


Then all we do
is blend in with traffic...


...without arousing suspicion.


Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.


Stop! Security.


- You and your insect pack your float?
- Yes.


Has it been
in your possession the entire time?


Would you remove your shoes?


- Remove your stinger.
- It's part of me.


I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.


Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.


Oan you believe how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the job!


I think this is gonna work.


It's got to work.


Attention, passengers,
this is Oaptain Scott.


We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.


It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.


Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.


I gotta get up there
and talk to them.


Be careful.


Oan I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?


I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.


Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.


- What'd you say, Hal?
- Nothing.


Bee!


Don't freak out! My entire species...


What are you doing?


- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?


Don't move.


Oh, Barry.


Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.


Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?


And please hurry!


What happened here?


There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.


One's bald, one's in a boat,
they're both unconscious!


- Is that another bee joke?
- No!


No one's flying the plane!


This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?


This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.


Where's the pilot?


He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.


Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?


As a matter of fact, there is.


- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.


From the honey trial?! Oh, great.


Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.


It's got giant wings, huge engines.


I can't fly a plane.


- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.


How hard could it be?


Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.


This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,


where a suspenseful scene
is developing.


Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...


That's Barry!


...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers


and an incapacitated flight crew.


Flowers?!


We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls


with absolutely no flight experience.


Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.


I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.


They've done enough damage.


But isn't he your only hope?


Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.


Their wings are too small...


Haven't we heard this a million times?


"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense."


- Get this on the air!
- Got it.


- Stand by.
- We're going live.


The way we work may be a mystery to you.


Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.


But let me tell you about a small job.


If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.


More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.


That's why I want to get bees
back to working together.


That's the bee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.


We get behind a fellow.


- Black and yellow!
- Hello!


Left, right, down, hover.


- Hover?
- Forget hover.


This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!


Barry, what happened?!


Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.


- That may have been helping me.
- And now we're not!


So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.


All of you, let's get
behind this fellow! Move it out!


Move out!


Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!


Don't have to yell.


I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.


It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!


It's not a tone. I'm panicking!


I can't do this!


Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!


You snap out of it.


You snap out of it.


- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!


- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!


- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!


- Hold it!
- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.


How is the plane flying?


I don't know.


Hello?


Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?


The Pollen Jocks!


They do get behind a fellow.


- Black and yellow.
- Hello.


All right, let's drop this tin can
on the blacktop.


Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?


No, nothing. It's all cloudy.


Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.


- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.


Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!


Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.


- What?
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.


Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.


Bring the nose down.


Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!


- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!


Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!


- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- OK.


Out the engines. We're going in
on bee power. Ready, boys?


Affirmative!


Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.


Land on that flower!


Ready? Full reverse!


Spin it around!


- Not that flower! The other one!
- Which one?


- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!


That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower


made of millions of bees!


Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.


Rotate around it.


- This is insane, Barry!
- This's the only way I know how to fly.


Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?


Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!


Just drop it. Be a part of it.


Aim for the center!


Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!


Oome on, already.


Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!


- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.


Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?


What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!


- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.


Listen, everyone!


This runway is covered
with the last pollen


from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.


That means this is our last chance.


We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.


If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?


Are we going to be bees, orjust
Museum of Natural History keychains?


We're bees!


Keychain!


Then follow me! Except Keychain.


Hold on, Barry. Here.


You've earned this.


Yeah!


I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.


Oh, yeah.


That's our Barry.


Mom! The bees are back!


If anybody needs
to make a call, now's the time.


I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!


Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Oan I help who's next?


Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.


Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!


Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!


I had no idea.


Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?


Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.


Sorry I'm late.


He's a lawyer too?


I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.


Have a great afternoon!


Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.


No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.


You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Oan I help who's next?


All right, scramble, jocks!
It's time to fly.


Thank you, Barry!


That bee is living my life!


Let it go, Kenny.


- When will this nightmare end?!
- Let it all go.


- Beautiful day to fly.
- Sure is.


Between you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.


You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend.


- Thinking bee!
- Me?


Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.


I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Oan we stop here?


I'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!


All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.


I had virtually no rehearsal for that.<p>
  <p>{Man} Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.

But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only

be broken by love's first kiss.

She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing

dragon.

Many brave knigts had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison,

but non prevailed.

She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest

tower for her true love and true love's first kiss.

{Laughing}

Like that's ever gonna happen.

{Paper Rusting, Toilet Flushes}

What a load of -



Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me

I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed

She was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb

In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

The years start comin' and they don't stop comin'

Fed to the rules and hit the ground runnin'

Didn't make sense not to live for fun

Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do so much to see

So what's wrong with takin' the backstreets

You'll never know if you don't go

You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey, now You're an all-star

Get your game on, go play

Hey, now You're a rock star

Get the show on, get paid

And all that glitters is gold

Only shootin' stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder

You're bundled up now but wait till you get older

But the meteor men beg to differ

Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin

The water's getting warm so you might as well swim

My world's on fire

How 'bout yours

That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

Hey, now, you're an all-star

{Shouting}

Get your game on, go play

Hey, now You're a rock star

Get the show on, get paid

And all that glitters is gold

Only shootin' stars break the mold

{Belches}

Go!

Go!

{Record Scratching}

Go. Go.Go.

Hey, now, you're an all-star

Get your game on, go play

Hey, now You're a rock star

Get the show on, get paid

And all that glitters is gold

Only shootin' stars break the mold



-Think it's in there?

-All right. Let's get it!

-Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?

-Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.

{Laughs}

-Yes, well, actually, that would be a gaint.

Now, ogres - - They're much worse.

They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin.

-No!

-They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes!

Actually, it's quite good on toast.

-Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!

{Gasping}

-Right.

{Roaring}

{Shouting}

{Roaring}

{Whispers} This is the part where you run away.

{Gasping}

{Laughs}

{Laughing} And stay out!

"Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."

{Sighs}

{Man's voice} All right. This one's full.

-Take it away!

{Gasps}

-Move it along. Come on! Get up!

-Next!

-Give me that! Your fiying days are over.

That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next!

-Get up! Come on!

-Twenty pieces.

{Thudding}

-Sit down there!

-Keep quiet!

{Crying}

-This cage is too small.

-Please, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again.

I can change. Please! Give me another chance!

-Oh, shut up.

-Oh!

-Next!

-What have you got?

-This little wooden puppet.

-I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy.

-Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away.

-Father, please! Don't let them do this!

-Help me!

-Next! What have you got?

-Well, I've got a talking donkey.

{Grunts}

-Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it.

-Oh, go ahead, little fella.

-Well?

-Oh, oh, he's just - - He's just a little nervous.

He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt - -

-That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!

-No, no, he talks! He does. I can talk. I love to talk.

I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw.

-Get her out of my sight.

-No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

{Gasps}

-Hey! I can fly!

-He can fly!

-He can fly!

-He can talk!

-Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey.

You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly

but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha!

Oh-oh.

{Grunts}

-Seize him!

-After him! He's getting away!

{Grunts, Gasps}

{Man}

-Get him! This way! Turn!

-You there. Orge!

-Aye?

-By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under

arrest

and transport you to a designated..... resettlement facility.

-Oh, really? You and what army?

{Gasps, Whimpering}

{Chuckles}

-Can I say something to you?

-Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here.

Incredible!

Are you talkin' to - - me? Whoa!

-Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great

back here? Those guards!

They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They

was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made

me feel good to see that.

-Oh, that's great. Really.

-Man, it's good to be free.

-Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends?

Hmm?

-But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by

myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you.

You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit

out of anybody that crosses us.

{Roaring}

-Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that

don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you

definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks!

You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time - -

{Mumbling}

Than I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases eking out of my

butt that day.

-Why are you following me?

-I'll tell you why.



'Cause I'm all alone

There's no one here beside me

My promlems have all gone

There's no one to deride me

But you gotta heve friends - -



-Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends.

-Wow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest.

-Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?

-Uh - - Really tall?

-No! I'm an orge! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't

that bother you?

-Nope.

-Really?

-Really, really.

-Oh.

-Man, I like you. What's you name?

-Uh, Shrek.

-Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek?

You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing.

I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. Whoo! Look at that.

Who'd want to live in place like that?

-That would be my home.

-Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a

decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I

like that boulder. That is a nice boulder.

-I guess you don't entertain much, do you?

-I like my privacy.

-You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I

hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them

a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence.

-Can I stay with you?

-Uh, what?

-Can I stay with you, please?

-Of course!

-Really?

-No.

-Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to

be considered a freak. Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta

stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!

-Okay! Okay! But one night only.

-Ah! Thank you!

-What are you - - No! No!

-This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories,

and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.

-Oh!

-Where do, uh, I sleep?

-Outside!

-Oh, well. I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you

don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know.

{Sniffles}

-Here I go.

-Good night.

{Sighs}

-I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside.

I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself,

outside.



I'm all alone

There's no one here beside me

{Bubbling}

{Sighs}

{Creaking}

{Sighs}

-I thought I told you to stay outside.

-I'm outside.

{Clattering}

-Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we

have?

-It's not home, but it'll do just fune.

-What a lovely bed.

-Got ya.

{Sniffs} I found some cheese.

-Ow! {Grunts}

-Blah! Awful stuff.

-Is that you, Gorder?

-How did you know?

-Enough! What are you doing in my house?

{Grunts}

-Hey!

{Snickers}

-Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table.

-Where are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken.

-Huh?

{Gusps}

{Male voice} What?

-I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying orge! What do I

have to do get a little privacy?

-Aah!

-Oh, no. No! No!

{Cackling}

-What?

-Quit it.

-Don't push.

{Squeaking}

{Lows}

- What are you doing in my swamp?

{Echoing}

Swamp! Swamp! Swamp!

{Gasping}

-Oh, dear!

-Whoa!

-All right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go!

Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey!

-Quickly. Come on!

-No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there.

-Oh!

{Sighs}

-Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them.

-Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

-What?

-We were forced to come here.

-By who?

-Lord Farquaad.

-He huffed und he puffed und he...... signed an eviction notice.

{Sighs}

-All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?

{Murmuring}

-Oh, I do. I know where he is.

-Does anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all?

-Me! Me!

-Anyone?

-Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me!

{Sighs}

-Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable.

Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy

Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came

from!

{Cheering}

{Twittering}

-Oh! You! You're comin' with me.

- All right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two

stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it!

-On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek.

-Hey. Oh, oh!

-I can't wait to get on the road again.

-What did I say about singing?

-Can I whistle?

-No.

-Can I hum it?

-All right, hum it.

{Humming}



{Grunts}

{Whimpering}

-That's enough. He's ready to talk.

{Coughing}

{Laughing}

{Clears throat}

-Run, run, run, as fust as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the

gingerbread man!

-You are a monster.

-I'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy

tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the

others?

-Eat me!{Grunts}

-I've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached

its end! Tell me or I'll - -

-No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons.

-All right then. Who's hiding them?

-Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man?

-The muffin man?

-The muffin man.

-Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?

-Well, she's married to the muffin man.

-The muffin man?

-The muffin man!

-She's married to the muffin man.

{Door opens}

-My lord! We found it.

-Then what are you waiting for? Bring it in.

{Man grunting}

{Gasping}

-Oh!

-Magic mirror - -

-Don't tell him anything!

-No!

{Ginerbread man whispers}

-Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect

kingdom of them all?

-Well, technically you're not a king.

-Uh, Thelonius.

-You were saying?

-What I mean is, you're not a king yet. But you can become one.  All

you have to do is marry a princess.

-Go on.

{Chuckles}

-So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to

meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette

number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away.

She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking

and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella.

-Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of

fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just

kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come

on. Give it up for Snow White!

-And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a

fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling

lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes

pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing,

Princess Fiona!

-So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or

bachelorette number three?

-Two! Two!

-Three! Three!

-Two! Two!

-Three!

-Three? One?

{Shudders} Three?

--Three! Pick number three, my lord!

-Okay, okay, uh, number three!

-Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona.



If you like pina coladas

And getting caught in the rain



-Princess Fiona.



If you're not into yoga



-She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go - -

-But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night.

-I'll do it.

-Yes, but after sunset - -

-Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will

finally have the perfect king!

Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament.



-But that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd

find it.

-So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.

-Uh-huh. That's the place.

-Do you think maybe he's compensating for something?

{Laughs}

{Groans}

-Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.

-Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.

-Hey, you!

{Screams}

-Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - -

{Whimpering}

{Sighs}

{Whimpering, Groans}

{Turnstile clatters}

{Chuckles}

{Sighs}

-It's quiet. Too quiet.

{Creaking}

-Where is everybody?

-Hey, look at this!

{Clattering, whirring, clicking}

Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town

Here we have some rules

Let us lay them down

Don't make waves, stay in line

And we'll get along fine

DuLoc is perfect place

Please keep off of the grass

Shine your shoes, wipe your... face

DuLoc is, DuLoc is

DuLoc is perfect ...... place

{Camera shutter clicks

{Whirring}

-Wow! Let's do that again!

-No. No. No, no, no! No.

{Trumpet fanfare}

{Crowd cheering}

-Brave knights.

-You are the best and brightest in all the land.

-Today one of you shall prove himself - -

-All right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom.

-Sorry about that.

{Cheering}

-That champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go

forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the

dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first

runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you mae

die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make.

{Cheering}

-Let the tournament begin!

{Gasps}

-Oh!

-What is that?

{Gasping}

-It's hideous!

-Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey.

-Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the orge will be named

champion! Have it him!

-Get him!

-Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now.

-Go ahead! Get him!

-Can't we just settle this over a pint?

-Kill the beast!

-No? All right then. Come on!



I don't give a damn about my reputation

You're living in the past

It's a new generation



-Damn!

{Whinnying}



A girl can do what she wants to do

And that's what I'm gonna do

And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation

Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me

Me, me, me



-Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!



And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation

Never said I wanted to improve my station



-Ah!

{Laughs}



And I'm always feelin' good when I'm having fun



-Yeah!



And I don't have to please no one



-The chair! Give him the chair!



And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation

Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me

Me, me, me

Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me, not me

{Bell dings}

{Cheering}

{Laughs}

-Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till

Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha!

{Shrek laughs}

{Crowd gasping, murmuring}

-Shall I give the order, sir?

-No, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion!

-What?

-Congratulations, orge. You're won the honor of embarking on a great

and noble quest.

-Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back.

-Your swamp?

-Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those tale creatures!

{Crowd murmuring}

-Indeed. All right, orge. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for

me, and I'll give you your swamp back.

-Exactly the way it was?

-Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.

-And the squatters?

-As good as gone.

-What kind of quest?

-Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a

princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only

don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place.

-Is that about right?

-Maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.

-I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that orge stuff on

him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make

your bread, the whole orge trip.

-Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and

put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and

drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you?

-Uh, no, not really, no.

-For your information, there's a lot more to orges than people think.

-Example?

-Example? Okay, um, orges are like onions.

-{Sniffs} They stink?

-Yes - - No!

-They make you cry?

-No!

-You leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little

white hairs.

-No! Layers! Onions have layers. Orges have layers! Onions have

layers. You get it? We both have layers.

{Sighs}

-Oh, you both have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, not everybody likes

onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers.

-I don't care... what everyone likes. Orges are not like cakes.

-You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a

person, you say, "Let's get some parfait," they say, "No, I don't like

no parfait"? Parfaits are delicious.

-No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Orges are like

onions! And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.

-Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.

-You know, I think I preferred your humming. Do you have a tissure or

something? I'm making a mess. Just the word parfait make me start

slobbering.



I'm on my way from misery to happiness today

Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

I'm on my way from misery to happiness today

Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

And everything that you receive up yonder

Is what you give to me the day I wander

I'm on my way

I'm on my way

I'm on my way



-Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that?

-You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was

open. Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. {Sniffs} It's

brimstone We must be getting close.

-Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I

know what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It didn't come off no stone

neither.

{Rumbling}

-Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location.

{Laughing}

-Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said orges have layers?

-Oh, aye.

-Well, I have a bit of a confession to make. Donkeys don't have

layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves.

-Wait a second.  Donkeys don't have sleeves.

-You know what I mean.

-You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.

-I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over

a boiling like of lava!

-Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional

support., we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step

at a time.

-Really?

-Really, really.

-Okay, that makes me feel so much better.

-Just keep moving. And don't look  down.

-Okay, don't look  down. Don't look  down. Don't look  down. Keep on

moving. Don't look  down.

{Gasps}

-Shrek! I'm lookin' down! Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off,

please!

-But you're already halfway.

-But I know that half is safe!

-Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.

-Shrek, no! Wait!

-Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall me?

-Don't do that!

-Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?

-Oh, this?

-Yes, that!

-Yes? Yes, do it. Okay.

{Screams}

-No, Shrek! No! Stop it!

-You said do it! I'm doin' it.

-I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. Oh!

-That'll do, Donkey. That'll do.

-Cool.

-So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?

-Inside, waiting for us to rescue her.

{Chuckles}

-I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.

{Water dripping, wind howling}

-You afraid?

-No.

-But - -

- Shh.

-Oh, good. Me neither.

{Gasps}

-'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible

response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I

might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and

breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little

scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that.

{Gasps}

-Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. Now go over there and see if

you can find any stairs.

-Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess.

-The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest

tower.

-What makes you think she'll be there?

-I read it in a book once.

-Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs. I'll find those

stairs. I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs won't know which way

they're goin'.

{Creacing}

-I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with

me. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a

step right here. I'd step all over it.

-Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the - -

-Dragon!

{Screams}

{Gasps}

{Roars}

-Donkey, look out!

{Screams}

{Whimpering}

-Got ya!

{Roars}

{Gasps}

{Shouts}

-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

{Screaming}

{Gasps}

-Oh! Aah! Aah!

{Gasping}

{Crowls}

-No. Oh, no, No!

{Screams}

-Oh, what large teeth you have.

{Crowls}

-I mean white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all time

from your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile

you got  there. Do I detect a hint of minty freshness? And you know

what else? You're - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! I mean, of

course you're a girl dragon. You're just reeking of feminine beauty.

What's the matter with you? You got something in your eye? Ohh. Oh.

Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know, I'm, uh - -

(Coughs)

-I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna

blow smoke rings. Shrek!

{Gasps}

{Whimpering}

-No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

{Groans, Sighs}

{Vocalizing}

-Oh! Oh!

-Wake up!

-What?

-Are you Princess Fiona?

-I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.

-Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!

-But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our first meeting. Should it not be

a wonderful, romantic moment?

-Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.

-Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should sweep me off my feet out

yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed.

-You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?

-Mm-hmm.

{Screams, grunts}

-But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for

me. A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!

-I don't think so.

-Can I at least know the name of my champion?

-Um, Shrek.

-Sir Shrek.

{Cleans throat}

-I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.

-Thanks!

{Roaring}

-You didn't slay the dragon?

-It's on my to-do list. Now come on!

{Screams}

-But this isn't right! You were meant to charge in, sword drawn,

banner flying. That's what all the other knights did.

-Yeah, right before they burst into flame.

-That's not the point. Oh!

-Wait. Where are you going? The next's over there.

-Well, I have to save my ass.

-What kind of knight are you?

-One of a kind.

-Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. I believe it's healthy to get to

know someone over a long perriod of time. Just call me old-fashioned.

{Laughs}

-I don't want to rush into a physical relationship. I'm not

emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this - -  Magnitude really

is the word I'm looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that is unwanted

physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just back

up a little and take this one step at a time. We really should get to

know each other first as friends or pen pals. I'm on the road a lot,

but I just love receiving cards - -  I'd really love to stay, but - -

Don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal tail. You're gonna

tear it off. I don't give permission - - What are you gonna do with

that? Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no. No! Oh!

{Growls}

{Roaring}

{Gasps}

-Hi, Princess!

-It talks!

-Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick.

{Screams}

{Screaming}

-Oh!

{Thuds}

{Groans}

{Roars}

{Roaring}

-Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll take care of the dragon.

{Fchoing}

-Run!

{Gasping}

{Screaming}

{Roaring}

{Screams}

{Roars}

{Panting, sighs}

{Whimpers}

{Roars}

-You did it!

-You rescued me! You're amazing. You're - - You're wonderful.

You're... a little unorthodox I'll admit. But they deed is great, and

thine heart is pure. I am eternally in your debt.

{Clears throat}

-And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed?

-I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She think I'm a

steed.

-The battle is won. You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight.

-Uh, no.

-Why not?

-I have helmet hair.

-Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer.

-No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st.

-But how will you kiss me?

-What? That wasn't in the job description.

-Maybe it's a perk.

-No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in

a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then

they share true love's first kiss.

-Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. Wait. You think that Shrek is you

true love?

-Well, yes.

{Laughing}

-You think Shrek is your true love!

-What is so funny?

-Let's just say I'm not your tipe, okay?

-Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. Now - - Now remove your

helmet.

-Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.

-Just take off the helmet.

-I'm not going to.

-Take ot off.

-No!

-Now!

-Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness.

-You- - You're a- - an orge.

-Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.

-Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed

to be an orge.

{Sighs}

-Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the

one who wants to marry you.

-Then why didn't he come rescue me?

-Good question. You should ask him that when we get there.

-But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some prge and his- -

his pet.

-So much for noble steed.

-You're not making my job any easier.

-I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell Lord Farquaad

that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right

here.

-Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? I'm a delivery boy.

-You wouldn't dare. Put me down!

-Ya comin', Donkey?

-I'm right behind ya.

-Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences! This is not

dignified! Put me down!

-Okay, so here's another question. Say there's a woman that digs you,

right, but you don't really like her that way. How do you let her down

real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a

crisp and eaten?

-You just tell her she's not your true love. Everyone knowest what

happens when you find your - -  Hey!

{Sighs}

-The sooner we get to DuLoc the better.

-You're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful!

-And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? What's he like?

-Let me put it this way, Princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in

short supply.

{Laughs}

-I don't know. There are those who think little of him.

-Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're just jealous you can never

measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.

-Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. But I'll let you do the

"measuring" when you see him tomorrow.

-Tomorrow? It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop to make camp?

-No, that'll take longer. We can keep going.

-But there's robbers in the woods.

-Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camping's starting to sound good.

-Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this

forest.

-I need to find somewhere to camp now!

{Birds wings fluttering}

{Grunting}

-Hey! Over here.

-Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think this is fit for a

princess.

-No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.

-Homey touches? Like what?

{Crashing}

-A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night.

-You want me to read you a bedtime story? I will.

-I said good night!

-Shrek, What are you doing?

{Laughs}

-I just- - You know - - Oh, come on. I was just kidding.

{Fire cracking}

-And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only orge to ever spit over

three wheat fields. Right. Yeah.

-Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?

-The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look,

there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for.

-I know you're making this up.

-No, look. There he is,  and there's the group of hunters running away

from his stench.

-That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.

-You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm?

Forget it.

{Sighs}

-Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?

-Our swamp?

-You know, when we're through rescuing the princess.

-We? Donkey, there's no "we". There's no "our". There's just me and my

swamp. The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall arond my

land.

-You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now. You know what

I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody

out.

-No, do ya think?

-Are you hidin' something?

-Never mind, Donkey.

-Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?

-No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it alone things.

-Why don't you want to talk about it?

-Why do you want to talk about it?

-Why are you blocking?

-I'm not blocking.

-Oh, yes, you are.

-Donkey, I'm warning you.

-Who you trying to keep out?

-Everyone! Okay?

-Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere.

-Oh! For the love of Pete!

-What's your problem? What you got against the whole world anyway?

-Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that

seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go.

"Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly orge!" They judge me before they

even know me. That's why I'm better off alone.

-You know what? When we met, I didn't think you was just a big,

stupid, ugly orge.

-Yeah, I know.

-So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?

-Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying.

-Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one

there?

-That's the moon.

-Oh, okay.



{Orchestra}

{Dulcimer}

-Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the

princess.

-Hmph.

-Ah. Perfect.

-Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that.

--Come on, baby. I said I like it.

-Donkey, wake up.

-Huh? What?

-Wake up.

-What?

-Good morning. Hm, how do you like your eggs?

-Good morning, Princess!

-What's all this about?

-You know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday. I wanted to

make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me.

-Uh, thanks.

{Sniffs}

-Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us.

{Belches}

-Shrek!

-What? It's a compliment. Better out than in, I always say. {Laughs}

-Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess.

{Belches}

-Thanks.

-She's as nasty as you are.

-{Laughs} You know, you're not exactly what I expected.

-Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them.

{Vocalizing}



-La liberte! Hey!

-Princess!

{Laughs}

-What are you doing?

-Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! And I am rescuing you from

this green - -

{Kissing sounds}

-beast.

-Hey!

-That's my princess! Go find you own!

-Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a little busy here?

-Look, pal, I don't know who you think you are!

-Oh! Of couse! Oh, how rude. Please let me introduse myself. Oh, Merry

Men.

That's bad

Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come from?

-What?

-That! Back there. That was amazing! Where did you learn that?

-Well - - {Chuckles} When one lives alone, uh, one has to learn these

things in case there's a - - There's an arrow in your butt!

-What? Oh, would you look at that?

-Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.

-Why? What's wrong?

-Shrek's hurt.

-Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die.

-Donkey, I'm okay.

-You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm too young for you to die. Keep

you legs elevated. Turn your head and cough. Does anyone know the

Heimlich?

-Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help Shrek, run into the woods and

find me a blue flower with red thorns.

-Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns.

Don't die Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!

-{Both} Donkey!

-Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns.

-What are the flowers for?

-For getting rid of Donkey.

-Ah.

-Now you hold still, and I'll yank this thing out.

-Ow! Hey! Easy with the yankin'.

-I'm sorry, but it has to come out.

-No, it's tender.

-Now, hold on.

-What you're doing is the opposite of help.

-Don't move.

-Look, time out.

-Would you - -

{Grunts}

-Okay. What do you propose we do?

-Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red

thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't color-blind! Blue

flower, red thorns.

-Ow!

-Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'!

-Ow! Not good.

-Okay. Okay. I can nearly see the head.

{Grunts}

-It's just about - -

-Ow! Ohh!

-Ahem.

-Nothing happend. We were just, uh - -

-Look, if you wanted to be alone, all you had to do was ask. Okay?

-Oh, come on! That's the last thing on my mind. The princess here was

just- - Ugh!

-Ow!

-Hey, what's that?

{Nervous chickle}

-That's- - Is that blood?

She will always be the only thing

That comes between me and the awful sting

That comes from living in a world

that's so damn mean

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

-Hey!

La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la

{Both laughing}

La-la, la-la, la-la



-There it is, Princess. Your future awaits you.

-That's DuLoc?

-Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for

something,  which I think means he has a really - - Ow!

-Um, I, uh- -  I guess we better move on.

-Sure. But, Shrek? I'm - - I'm worried about Donkey.

{Blubbering}

-What?

-I mean, look at him. He doesn't look so good.

-What are you talking about? I'm fine.

-That's what they always say, and then next thing you know, you're on

your back. Dead.

-You know, she's right. You look awful. Do you want to sit down?

-Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea.

-I didn't want to say nothin', but I got this twinge in my neck, and

when I turn my head like this, look,

{Bones crunch}

-Ow! See?

-Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.

-I'll get the firewood.

-Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't feel my toes! I don't have any

toes! I think I need a hug.



-Mmm. This is good. This is really good. What is this?

-Uh, weedrat. Rotisserie style.

-No kidding. Well, this is delicious.

-Well, they're also great in stews. Now, I don't mean to brag, but I

make a mean weedrat stew.

{Chuckling}

{Sighs}

-I guess I'll be dining a little differently tomorrow night.

{Gulps}

-Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook all kind

of stuff for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - you name it.

{Chuckles}

-I'd like that.

{Slurps, laughs}



See the pyramids along the Nile



-Um, Princess?



Watch the sunrise from a tropic isle



-Yes, Shrek?

-I, um, I was wondering.



Just remember, darling all the while



-Are you- -



You belong to me



{Sighs}

-Are you gonna eat that?

{Chuckles}

-Man, isn't this romantic? Just look at that sunset.

-Sunset?

-Oh, no! I mean, it's late. I-It's very late.

-What?

-Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on here. You're afraid of the dark,

aren't you?

-Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. You know, I'd better go inside.

-Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until

- - Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.

{Shrek sighs}

 -Good night.

 -Good night.

{Door creaks}

-Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on here.

-Oh, what are you talkin' about?

-I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts.

And I know you two were diggin' on each other. I could feel it.

-You're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.

-Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the pheromones. Just go on in

and tell her how you feel.

-I- - There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that,

well, you know - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause I don't - - she's a

princess, and I'm - -

-An orge?

-Yeah. An orge.

-Hey, where you goin'?

-To get... move firewood.

{Sighs}



-Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, where are you?

{Wings fluttering}

-Princess?

{Creaking}

{Gasps}

-It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing no games.

{Screams}

-Aah!

-Oh, no!

-No, help!

-Shh!

-Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

-No, it's okay. It's okay.

-What did you do with the princess?

-Donkey, I'm the princess.

-Aah!

-It's me, in this body.

-Oh, my God! You ate the princess. Can you hear me?

-Donkey!

-Listen, keep breathing! I'll get you out of there!

-No!

-Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

-Shh.

-Shrek!

-This is me.

{Muffled mumbling}

-Princess? What happened to you? You're, uh, uh, uh, different.

-I'm ugly, okay?

-Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats

was a bad idea. You are what you eat, I said. Now - -

-No.

-I - - I've been this way as long as I can remember.

-What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before.

-It's only happens when sun goes down.

"By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm... until you

find true love's first kiss... and then take love's true form."

-Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.

-It's a spell.

{Sighs}

-When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I

become this. This horrible, ugly beast! I was placed in a tower to

await the day my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry

Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this.

{Sobs}

-All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not

that ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. But you only look

like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24-7.

-But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant

to look.

-Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad?

-I have to.  Only my true love's kiss can break the spell.

-But, you know, um, you're kind of an orge, and Shrek - - well, you

got a lot in common.

-Shrek?



-Princess, I - - Uh, how's it going, first of all? Good? Um, good for

me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's

pretty and - - well, I don't really like it, but I thought you might

like it 'cause you're pretty. But I like you anyway. I'd - - uh, uh -

-

{Sighs}

-I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go.

-I can't just marry whoever I want. Take a good look at me, Donkey. I

mean, really, who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly?

"Princess" and "ugly" don't go together. That's why I can't stay here

with Shrek.

{Gasps}

-My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.

{Deep sigh}

-Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only

way to break the spell.

-You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.

-No! You can't breathe a word. No one must ever know.

-What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets?

-Promise you won't tell. Promise!

-All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should. I just know

before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy.

-Look at my eye twitchin'.

{Door opens}

{Snoring}

-I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him.

-Shrek! Shrek, there's something I want - -

{Snoring}

-Shrek. Are you all right?

-Perfect! Never been better.

-I - - I don't - - There's something I have to tell you.

-You don't have to tell me anything, Princess. I heard enough last

night.

-You heard what I said?

-Every word.

-I thought you'd understand.

-Oh, I undersatnd. Like you said, "Who could love a hideous, ugly

beast?"

-But I thought that wouldn't matter to you.

-Yeah? Well, it does.

{Gasps, sighs}

-Ah, right on time.

{Horse whinnies}

-Princess, I've brought you a little something.

{Fanfare}

{Yawns}

-What'd I miss? What'd I miss?

{Muffled}

-Who said that? Couldn't have been a donkey.

-Princess Fiona.

-As promised. Now hand it over.

-Very well, orge. The deed to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed.

-Take it and go before I change my mind.

-Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I

have never seen such a radiant beauty before. I'm Lord Farquaad.

-Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no.

{Snaps fingers}

-Forgive me, my lord, for I was just saying a short... farewell.

-Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have to waste good manners on the

orge. It's not like it has feelings.

-No, you're right. It doesn't.

-Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawerss Fiona. I ask your hand in

marriage.

{Gasps}

-Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?

-Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make - -

-Excellent! I'll start the plans, for tomorrow we wed!

-No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get married today before the sun

sets.

-Oh, anxious, are you? You're right. The sooner, the better. There's

so much to do! Threre's the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest

list. Captain, round up some guests!

-Fare-thee-well, orge.

-Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her get away.

-Yeah? So what?

-Shrek, there's something about her you don't know. Look, I talked to

her last night, She's - -

-I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya?

Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?

-Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you.

-I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone!

My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless,

pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!

-But I thought - -

-Yeah. You know what? You tought wrong!

-Shrek.



I heard there was a secret chord

That David played and it pleased the Lord

But you don't really care for music, do ya

It goes like this the fourth, the fifth

The minor fall the major lift

The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah,  hallelujah

Baby, I've been here before

I know this room I've walked this floor

I used to live alone before I knew you

I've seen your flag on the marble arch

But love is not a victory march

It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah,  hallelujah

And all I ever learned from love

Is how to shoot at someone

Who outdrew you

{Moaning}

And it's not a cry you can hear at night

It's not somebody who's seen the light

It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

{Moaning}

Hallelujah,  hallelujah



{Thumping sound}

-Donkey?

{Grunts}

-What are you doing?

-I would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you see

one.

-Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not

through it.

-It is around your half. See that's your half, and this is my half.

-Oh! Your half. Hmm.

-Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I

get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks

like your head.

-Back off!

-No, you back off.

-This is my swamp!

-Our swamp.

-Let go, Donkey!

-You let go.

-Stubborn jackass!

-Smelly orge.

-Fine!

-Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you yet.

-Well, I'm through with you.

-Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, "Me, me, me!" Well, guess

what! Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are

mean to me. You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do!

You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.

-Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?

-Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!

-Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive you... for stabbin' me in

the back!

-Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your

own feelings.

-Go away!

-There you are , doing it again just like you did to Fiona. All she

ever do was like you, maybe even love you.

-Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature. I heard the two of

you talking.

-She wasn't talkin' about you. She was talkin' about, uh, somebody

else.

-She wasn't talking about me? Well, then who was she talking about?

-Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me.

Right? Right?

-Donkey!

-No!

-Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right?

{Sighs}

-I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly orge. Can you

forgive me?

-Hey, that's what friends are for, right?

-Right. Friends?

-Friends.

-So, um, what did Fiona say about me?

-What are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her?

-The wedding! We'll never make it in time.

-Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's a will, there's a way and I

have a way.

{Whistles}

-Donkey?

-I guess it's just my animal magnetism.

{Laughing}

-Aw, come here, you.

-All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass.

All right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't had a chance to install

the seat belts yet.

-Whoo!

{Bells tolling}

{All gasping}

-People of DuLoc, we gather here today to bear witnss to the union....

-Um-

-of our new king - -

-Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead to the "I do's"?

{Chuckling}

-Go on.

-Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN. If we need you, I'll whistle. How about

that? Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You wanna do this right, don't

you?

-What are you talking about?

-There's a line you gotta wait for. The preacher's gonna say, "Speak

now or forever hold your peace." That's when you say, "I object!"

-I don't have time for this!

-Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! Look, you love this

woman, don't you?

-Yes.

-You wanna hold her?

-Yes.

-Please her?

-Yes!

-Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness. The chicks love that

romantic crap!

-All right! Cut it out. When does this guy say the line?

-We gotta check it out.



-And so, by the power vested in me,

-What do you see?

-The whole town's in there.

-I now pronounce you husband and wife,

-They're at the altar.

-king and queen.

-Mother Fletcher! He already said it.

-Oh, for the love of Pete!

{Grunts}

-I object!

-Shrek?

{Gasps}

-Oh, now what does he want?

-Hi, everyone. Havin' a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first at all.

Very clean.

-What are you doing here?

-Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you, but

showing up uninvited to a wedding - -

-Fiona! I need to talk to you.

-Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little late for that, so if you'll

excuse me - -

-But you can't marry him.

-And why not?

-Because- - Because he's just marring you so he can be king.

-Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.

-He's not your true love.

-And what do you know about true love?

-Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - -

-Oh, this is precious. The orge has fallen in love with the princess!

Oh, good Lord.

{Crowd laughting}

-An orge and a princess!

-Shrek, is this true?

-Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away

from our "happily ever after." Now kiss me! Mmmmm!

-"By night one way, by day another." I wanted to show you before.

{Whimpers}

{Crown gasping}

-Well, uh, that explains a lot.

-Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! I order you to get that out of

my sight now! Get them! Get them both!

-No, no!

-Shrek!

-This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This marriage is binding, and that

makes me king! See? See?

-No, let go of me! Shrek!

-No!

-Don't just stand there, you morons.

-Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh!

-I'll make you regret the day we met. I'll see you drawn and

quartered!

-You'll beg for death to save you!

-No, Shrek!

-And as for you, my wife,

-Fiona!

-I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days!

-I'm king!

{Whistles}

-I will have order! I will have perfection! I will have - - Aaaah!

-Aah!

-All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to

use it.

{Roars}

-I'm a donkey on the edge!

{Belches}

-Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they?

{Cheering}

-Go ahead, Shrek.

-Uh, Fiona?

-Yes, Shrek?

-I - - I love you.

-Really?

-Really, really.

- I love you too.

-Aawww!

-"Until you find true love's first kiss and then take love's true

form."

-"Take love's true form. Take love's true form."

-Fiona? Fiona. Are you all right?

-Well, yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed to be beautiful.

-But you ARE beautiful.

{Chuckles}

-I was hoping this would be a happy ending.



I thought love was only true in fairy tales

Oy!

Meant for someone else but not for me

Love was out to get me

That's the way it seemed

Disappointment haunted all my dreams

And then I saw her face

Now I'm a believer and not a trace

Of doubt in my mind

I'm in love

Ooh-aah

I'm a believer I couldn't leave her

If I tried



-God bless us, every one.



Come on, y'all!

Then I saw her face

Ha-ha

Now I'm a believer

Listen!

Not a trace

Of doubt in my mind

I'm in love

Ooh-aah

I'm a believer

I couldn't leave her if I tried

-Ooh!

-Uh!

Then I saw her face

Now I'm a believer

Hey!

Not a trace

Uhh! Yeah.

Of doubt in my mind



-One more time!

I'm in love

I'm a believer

Come on!

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe,

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, hey

Y'all sing it with me!

I

Believe

I believe

People in the back!

I believe

I'm a believer

I believe

I believe

I believe

I believe

{Hysterical laughing}

-Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh.

-I can't breathe. I can't breathe.



I believe in self-assertion

Destiny or a slight diversion

Now it seems I've got my head on straight

I'm a freak an apparition

Seems I've made the right decision

To try to turn back now it might be too late



Now I want to stay home today

Shrek 2 Script





[man's voice] Once upon a time

in a kingdom far, far away,







the king and queen were blessed

with a beautiful baby girl.







And throughout the land,

everyone was happy...







until the sun went down







and they saw that their daughter was

cursed with a frightful enchantment







that took hold each and every night.







Desperate, they sought the help

of a fairy godmother







who had them lock the young princess

away in a tower,







there to await the kiss...

of the handsome Prince Charming.







[horse whinnies]







It was he who would chance

or dragon-guarded castle.







You wouldn't understand.

You're not her father!







It's so nice to have the family

together for dinner.

Oh, my dear.

Oh, look at you.







You're all grown up.







- Who are you?

- Oh, sweet pea!







I'm your fairy godmother.

Stop!







[chuckles] Look...







Thank you very much,

Fairy Godmother,







but I really don't need all this.







[gasps and mutterings of disapproval]







- Fine. Be that way.

- We didn't like you, anyway.







- [knocking]

- [Shrek] Fiona? Fiona?







[dog barks]







Oh! You got a puppy?

All I got in my room was shampoo.







Oh, uh...







Fairy Godmother, furniture...







[giggles]







I'd like you to meet my husband, Shrek.







Your husband? What? What did you say?

When did this happen?







Shrek is the one who rescued me.







- But that can't be right.

- Oh, great, more relatives!







She's just trying to help.







Good! She can help us pack.

Get your coat, dear. We're leaving.







- What?

- I don't want to leave.







When did you decide this?







- Shortly after arriving.

- Look, I'm sorry...







No, that's all right.

I need to go, anyway.







But remember, dear.

If you should ever need me...







happiness...







is just a teardrop away.







Thanks, but we've got all

the happiness we need.







Happy, happy, happy...







[laughs] So I see.







Let's go, Kyle.







- Very nice, Shrek.

- What?







I told you coming here was a bad idea.







You could've at least tried

to get along with my father.







I don't think I was going to get

Daddy's blessing,







even if I did want it.







Do you think it might be nice

if somebody asked me what I wanted?







Sure. Do you want me

to pack for you?







You're unbelievable!

You're behaving like a...







- Go on! Say it!

- Like an ogre!







Here's a news flash for you!







Whether your parents like it or not...

I am an ogre!







- [yelps]

- [roars]







And guess what, Princess?

That's not about to change.







I've made changes for you, Shrek.

Think about that.







That's real smooth, Shrek.

"I'm an ogre!"







[mimics Shrek roaring]







[sniffling]







I knew this would happen.







[Lillian] You should.

You started it.







I can hardly believe that, Lillian.

He's the ogre. Not me.







I think, Harold, you're taking this

a little too personally.







This is Fiona's choice.







But she was supposed to choose

the prince we picked for her.







I mean, you expect me to give

my blessings to this... thing?







Fiona does.

And she'll never forgive you if you don't.







I don't want to lose

our daughter again, Harold.







Oh, you act as if love

is totally predictable.







Don't you remember when

we were young?







We used to walk

down by the lily pond and...







- they were in bloom...

- Our first kiss.







It's not the same!







I don't think you realize that

our daughter has married a monster!







Oh, stop being such a drama king.







Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong!







La, di, da, di, da!

Isn't it all wonderful!







I'd like to know

how it could get any worse!







- Hello, Harold.

- [gasps]







- What happened?

- Nothing, dear!







Just the old crusade wound

playing up a bit!







[chuckles]







I'll just stretch it

out here for a while.







You better get in.

We need to talk.







Actually, Fairy Godmother,

off to bed.







[yawns] Already taken my pills,

and they tend to make me a bit drowsy.







So, how about... we make this

a quick visit. What?







Oh, hello.

Ha-ha-ha!







So, what's new?







You remember my son,

Prince Charming?







Is that you? My gosh!

It's been years.







When did you get back?







Oh, about five minutes ago, actually.







After I endured blistering winds,

scorching desert...







I climbed to the highest room

in the tallest tower...







Mommy can handle this.







He endures blistering winds

and scorching desert!







He climbs to the highest bloody room

of the tallest bloody tower...







And what does he find?







Some gender-confused wolf

telling him that his princess







is already married.







It wasn't my fault.

He didn't get there in time.







Stop the car!







[crash]







Harold.







You force me to do something

I really don't want to do.







[gasps] Where are we?







Hi. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy!

May I take your order?







My diet is ruined!

I hope you're happy. Er... okay.







Two Renaissance Wraps,

no mayo... chili rings...







- I'll have the Medieval Meal.

- One Medieval Meal and, Harold...







- Curly fries?

- No, thank you.







- Sourdough soft taco, then?

- No, really, I'm fine.







Your order, Fairy Godmother.

This comes with the Medieval Meal.







There you are, dear.







We made a deal, Harold, and I assume

you don't want me to go back on my part.







[sighs deeply] Indeed not.







So, Fiona and Charming will be together.







- Yes.

- Believe me, Harold. It's what's best.







Not only for your daughter...







but for your Kingdom.







What am I supposed to do about it?







Use your imagination.

[clears throat] Excuse me.







Do I know you?







No, you must be mistaking me

for someone else.







Uh... excuse me.

I'm looking for the Ugly Stepsister.







Ah! There you are. Right.







You see, I need to have

someone taken care of.







- Who's the guy?

- Well, he's not a guy, per se.







Um... He's an ogre.







[crowd gasp]







Hey, buddy, let me clue you in.







There's only one fellow who can handle

a job like that, and, frankly...







he don't like to be disturbed.







he don't like to be disturbed.







Where could I find him?







[knock on door]







Hello?







Who dares enter my room?







Sorry! I hope I'm not interrupting, but

I'm told you're the one to talk to







about an ogre problem?







You are told correct.







But for this, I charge

a great deal of money.







Would... this be enough?







You have engaged my valuable

services, Your Majesty.







Just tell me where

I can find this ogre.

Sleeping Beauty is having

but Dad says I can't go.

He never lets me out after sunset.







Dad says I'm going away for a while.







Must be like some finishing school.







Mom says that when I'm old enough,







my Prince Charming will rescue me

from my tower

No, no. I was just reading a, uh...

a scary book.







I was hoping you'd let me apologize

for my despicable behavior earlier.







- Okay...

- I don't know what came over me.







Do you suppose we could pretend

it never happened and start over...







- Look, Your Majesty, I just...

- Please. Call me Dad.







Dad. We both acted like ogres.







Maybe we just need some time

to get to know each other.







Excellent idea! I was actually hoping

you might join me for a morning hunt.

Oh, great. My one chance

to fix things up with Fiona's dad

Don't get huffy!

I know! I know.

- Hey, don't worry about it.







I just really need to make

things work with this guy.







Yeah, sure. Now let's go

I know it was kind of a tender

moment back there, but the purring?







What? I ain't purring.







Sure. What's next? A hug?







Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr.

What do you think I am, some kind of a...







Ha-ha!

Look! A little cat.

- It's a cat, Donkey.







Come here,

Come on, little kitty. Come here.

Oh! Come here, little kitty.

What should we do with him?







Take the sword and neuter him.

Give him the Bob Barker treatment.







Oh, no! Por favor!

Please!







I implore you!

It was nothing personal, Señor.







I was doing it only for my family.







My mother, she is sick.

And my father lives off the garbage!







The King offered me much in gold

and I have a litter of brothers...







Whoa, whoa, whoa!







Fiona's father paid you to do this?







The rich King? Sí.







[screams]







Well, so much for Dad's royal blessing.







Don't feel bad. Almost everybody

that meets you wants to kill you.







Gee, thanks.







Maybe Fiona would've been better off

if I were some sort of Prince Charming.







That's what the King said.







Oh, uh... sorry. I thought that question

was directed at me.







Shrek, Fiona knows

you'd do anything for her.







Well, it's not like

I wouldn't change if I could.







I just... I just wish

I could make her happy.







Hold the phone...







"Happiness."







"A tear drop away."







Donkey! Think of the saddest thing

that's ever happened to you!







Aw, man, where do I begin?







First there was the time that old farmer

tried to sell me for some magic beans.







Then this fool had a party and he have

the guests trying to pin the tail on me.







Then they got drunk and start beating me

with a stick, going "Piñata!!"







What is a piñata, anyway?







No, Donkey! I need you to cry!







Don't go projecting on me.







I know you're feeling bad,

but you got to...







Aaaahhh!







You little, hairy,

litter-licking sack of...







What? Is it on? Is it on?







[clears throat]







This is Fairy Godmother.







I'm either away

from my desk or with a client.







But if you come by the office, we'll be

glad to make you an appointment.







Have a "happy ever after."







Oh...







Are you up for a little quest, Donkey?







That's more like it! Shrek and Donkey,

on another whirlwind adventure!







  Ain't no stoppin' us now! Whoo!

We're on the move!







- Stop, Ogre! I have misjudged you.

- Join the club. We've got jackets.







On my honor, I am obliged to accompany

you until I have saved your life







as you have spared me mine.







The position of annoying talking animal

has already been taken.







Let's go, Shrek. Shrek?







- Shrek!

- Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him...







in his wee little boots.







You know, how many cats can wear boots?

Honestly.







- Let's keep him!

- Say what?







[purrs]







Ahh!







Listen. He's purring!







- Oh, so now it's cute.

- Come on, Donkey. Lighten up.







Lighten up? I should lighten up?

Look who's telling who to lighten up!







Lighten up? I should lighten up?

Look who's telling who to lighten up!







[giggles] Shrek!







[barks]







[barks]







Shrek?







They're both festive, aren't they?







What do you think, Harold?







Um... Yes, yes.

Fine. Fine.







[sighs]







Try to at least pretend you're interested

in your daughter's wedding ball.







Honestly, Lillian,

I don't think it matters.







How do we know there will

even be a ball?







Mom. Dad.







- Oh, hello, dear.

- What's that, Cedric? Right! Coming.







Mom, have you seen Shrek?







I haven't.

You should ask your father.







Be sure and use small words, dear.

He's a little slow this morning.







- Can I help you, Your Majesty?

- Ah, yes! Um...







Mmm! Exquisite.

What do you call this dish?







That would be the dog's breakfast,

Your Majesty.







Ah, yes. Very good, then.

Carry on, Cedric.







- Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek?

- No, I haven't, dear.







I'm sure he just went off to look for

a nice... mud hole to cool down in.







You know, after your

little spat last night.







Oh. You heard that, huh?







The whole kingdom heard you.







I mean, after all,

it is in his nature to be...







well, a bit of a brute.







Him? You know, you didn't exactly

roll out the Welcome Wagon.







Well, what did you expect?

Look at what he's done to you.







Shrek loves me for who I am.







I would think you'd be happy for me.







Darling, I'm just thinking about

what's best for you.







Maybe you should do the same.







[both whisper]







No, really?







[both laugh]







[Shrek] Shh...







Oh...







[hooter blasts]







Oh, no. That's the old Keebler's place.

Let's back away slowly.







That's the Fairy Godmother's cottage.







She's the largest producer of hexes

and potions in the whole kingdom.







Then why don't we pop in there

for a spell? Ha-ha! Spell!







[Puss in Boots

shrieks with laughter]







[Puss in Boots] He makes me laugh.







Hi. I'm here to see the...







The Fairy Godmother.

I'm sorry. She is not in.







Jerome!

Coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now!







[sighs]







Yes, Fairy Godmother.

Right away.







Look, she's not seeing

any clients today, OK?







That's OK, buddy.

We're from the union.







The union?







We represent the workers in all magical

industries, both evil and benign.







Oh! Oh, right.







Are you feeling at all

degraded or oppressed?







Uh... a little.

We don't even have dental.







They don't even have dental.







Okay, we'll just have

a look around.







Oh. By the way.







I think it'd be better if the Fairy Godmother

didn't know we were here.







- Know what I'm saying? Huh?

- Huh? Huh? Huh?







- Stop it.

- Of course. Go right in.







[voices and grinding machines]







[explosion]







A drop of desire.







[giggles] Naughty!







A pinch of passion.







[laughs]







And just a hint of...







lust!







[laughs]







- [Shrek] Excuse me.

- [gasps]







Sorry to barge in like this...







What in Grimm's name

are you doing here?







Well, it seems

that Fiona's not exactly happy.







Oh-ho-ho!







And there's some question

as to why that is?







Well, let's explore that, shall we?







Ah. P, P, P...

Princess. Cinderella.







Here we are.

"Lived happily ever after." Oh...







[laughs] No ogres!







Let's see. Snow White.







A handsome prince.

Oh, no ogres.







Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres!







Hansel and Gretel? No!

Thumbelina? No.







The Golden Bird,

the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman...







No, no, no, no, no!







You see, ogres don't

live happily ever after.







All right, look, lady!







Don't you point...

those dirty green sausages at me!







Your Monte Cristo and coffee.







Oh! Sorry.







Ah... that's okay.







We were just leaving.







Very sorry to have wasted your time,

Miss Godmother.







Just... go.







Come on, guys.







[whistles tune]







TGIF, eh, buddy?







Working hard or hardly working,

eh, Mac?







Get your fine Corinthian footwear

and your cat cheeks out of my face!







Man, that stinks!







You don't exactly smell like

a basket of roses.







- Well, one of these has got to help.

- I was just concocting this very plan!







Already our minds are becoming one.







Whoa, whoa. If we need an expert on

licking ourselves, we'll give you a call.







Shrek, this is a bad idea.







Look. Make yourself useful

and go keep watch.







Puss, do you think you

could get to those on top?







No problema, boss.

In one of my nine lives,







I was the great cat burglar

of Santiago de Compostela.







Ha-ha-ha-ha!







Shrek, are you off your nut?







Donkey, keep watch.







Keep watch?

Yeah, I'll keep watch.







I'll watch that wicked witch come and

whammy a world of hurt up your backside.







I'll laugh, too.

I'll be giggling to myself.







- What do you see?

- Toad Stool Softener?







I'm sure a nice BM is the perfect solution

for marital problems.







- Elfa Seltzer?

- Uh-uh.







- Hex Lax?

- No! Try "handsome."







Sorry. No handsome.







Hey! How about "Happily Ever After"?







Well, what does it do?







It says "Beauty Divine."







In some cultures, donkeys are revered

as the wisest of creatures.







Especially us talking ones.







[gasps] Donkey!







That'll have to do.

We've got company.







Can we get on with this?







Hurry!







Nice catch, Donkey!







Finally! A good use for your mouth.







[  Pete Yorn: Ever Fallen In Love]







Come on!







  You spurn my natural emotions







  You make me feel like dirt

and I'm hurt







  And if I start a commotion







  I run the risk of losing you

Just get this place cleaned up!







And somebody bring me something

deep fried and smothered in chocolate!







- Mother!

- Charming. Sweetheart.







This isn't a good time, pumpkin.

Mama's working.







Whoa, what happened here?







- The ogre, that's what!

- What? Where is he, Mom?







I shall rend his head

from his shoulders!







I will smite him where he stands!







He will rue the very day he stole

my kingdom from me!







Oh, put it away, Junior!

You're still going to be king.







We'll just have to come up

with something smarter.







Pardon. Um...







Everything is accounted for,

Fairy Godmother, except for one potion.







What?







Oh...







I do believe we can make

this work to our advantage.

Hey, man, this don't feel right.

My donkey senses are tingling all over.







Drop that jug o' voodoo

It says, "Beauty Divine."

How bad can it be?







[sneezes]







See, you're allergic to that stuff.

You'll have a reaction.







And if you think that I'll be smearing

Boss, just in case there is something

wrong with the potion...

Oh, no, no. I don't think so.







If there'll be any animal testing,

I'll do it.







That's the best friend's job.

Now give me that bottle.







How do you feel?







I don't feel any different.

I look any different?







You still look like an ass to me.







Maybe it doesn't work on donkeys.







- Well, here's to us, Fiona.

- Shrek?







- You drink that, there's no going back.

- No more wallowing in the mud?

- I know.







- No more itchy butt crack?

- I know!







- But you love being an ogre!

Don't worry. Things seem bad

Ah! Excellent!

That's my girl.







It was a mistake to bring Shrek here.

And then we'll go back

to the swamp where we belong.

I'm Jill. What's your name?







- Um... Shrek.

- Shrek? Wow. Are you from Europe?







- You're tense.

- I want to rub his shoulders.







- I got it covered.

- I don't have anything to rub.

Look at me, Shrek!

I'm trotting!







That's some quality potion.

What's in that stuff?







"Oh, don't take the potion,

Mr. Boss, it's very bad."







Pah!

Shrek and I took some magic potion.

Aye, Fiona. It is me.







What happened to your voice?







The potion changed

a lot of things, Fiona.







But not the way I feel about you.

you'd approve.

And now she can be.







Oh, sweetheart.







She's finally found

the prince of her dreams.







But look at me.

Look what I've done for her.







It's time you stop living

in a fairy tale, Shrek.







She's a princess,

and you're an ogre.







That's something no amount

of potion will ever change.







But...

Hey. Why the long face?







It was all just a stupid mistake.







I never should have rescued her

from that tower in the first place.

I can't believe you'd walk away from

the best thing that happened to you.







What choice do I have?







She loves that pretty boy,

Prince Charming.







Come on. Is he really

that good-looking?







Are you kidding?

He's gorgeous!







He has a face that looks like

it was carved by angels.







- Oh. He sounds dreamy.

- You know...







shockingly, this isn't

making me feel any better.







Look, guys.

It's for the best.

I don't get it, Shrek.

You love Fiona.







Aye.







And that's why

I have to let her go.







Excuse me, is she here?







She's, uh... in the back.







Oh, hello again.







Fairy Godmother. Charming.







You'd better have a good reason

for dragging us down here, Harold.







Well, I'm afraid Fiona isn't really...

warming up to Prince Charming.







- FYI, not my fault.

- No, of course it's not, dear.







I mean,

how charming can I be







when I have to pretend

I'm that dreadful ogre?







No, no, it's nobody's fault.







Perhaps it's best if we just

call the whole thing off, okay?







- [both] What?

- You can't force someone to fall in love!







I beg to differ.

I do it all the time!







Have Fiona drink this and she'll fall in love

with the first man she kisses,







which will be Charming.







- Umm... no.

- What did you say?







I can't. I won't do it.







Oh, yes, you will.

with your happily ever after.

I changed for your mother.







Change?

Lots and lots of flour.







Gingy!







Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man!

We've got a big order to fill!







[evil chuckle]







[Gingy] It's alive!







[rattling]







[gasping]







[whinnies] Run, run, run,

as fast you can!







[screaming]







Go, baby, go!







There it is, Mongo!

To the castle!







[Shrek] No, you great stupid pastry!

Come on!







[all shout]







[Donkey] Mongo! Down here!

Look at the pony!







That's right! Follow the pretty pony!







Pretty pony wants to play

at the castle!







[Mongo] Pretty pony.







Ladies and gentlemen.







Presenting Princess Fiona

and her new husband, Prince Shrek.







[applause, cheering]







Shrek, what are you doing?







I'm just playing the part, Fiona.







Is that glitter on your lips?







Mm. Cherry flavored.

Want to taste?







- Ugh! What is with you?

- But, Muffin Cake...







[piano plays]







C Minor, put it in C Minor.







Ladies and gentlemen.







[applause, cheering]







I'd like to dedicate this song to...







Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.







Fiona, my Princess.







Will you honor me with a dance?







  Where have all the good men gone







  And where are all the gods?







[all chant] Dance!







  Where's the streetwise Hercules







  To fight the rising odds?







Since when do you dance?







Fiona, my dearest,

if there's one thing I know,







it's that love is full of surprises.







  Late at night I toss and I turn







  And I dream of what I need







Hit it!







  I need a hero







All right, big fella!

Let's crash this party!







Man the catapults!







Aim! Fire!







- Brace yourselves!

- Ooh! Purty!







[groaning]







Not the gumdrop button!







[enraged howling]







Incoming!







Ha-ha! All right!







  Somewhere after midnight

In my wildest fantasy







Go, Mongo! Go!







Man the cauldrons!







After you, Mongo.







- That's it! Heave-ho!

- Watch out!







Shrek!







More heat, less foam!







  Up where the mountains

Meet the heavens above







  Out where the lightning

Splits the sea







  I could swear there is someone

Somewhere watching me







Heave! Ho!







[Gingy, slow-motion] No...!







[Mongo groans]







[whistles] Come on!







[cheering]







Look out!







- Be good.

- [weeping bitterly]







[sobbing] He needs me!

Let me go!







Donkey!







Puss!







Go! Go! Your lady needs you! Go!







Today, I repay my debt.







[all] Aww...







[growling] On guard!







  He's gotta be strong

And he's gotta be fast







  And he's gotta be fresh

From the fight







-   I need a hero

- Stop!







[Donkey whinnies]







- Hey, you! Back away from my wife.

- Shrek?







You couldn't just go back to your swamp

and leave well enough alone.







- Now!

- Pigs und blanket!







Pinocchio! Get the wand!







I see London! I see France!







Whah!

Ah! Ah! Aaahhh!







Catch!







Donkey!







Oh!







I'm a real boy. Aah!







Oh!







- Ha!

- Ah.







That's mine!







Pray for mercy, from Puss...







And Donkey!







She's taken the potion!

Kiss her now!







No!







- Hi-ya!

- [crowd gasp]







- Fiona.

- Shrek.







Harold! You were supposed

to give her the potion!







Well, I guess I gave her

the wrong tea.







- [Charming] Mommy!

- Mommy?







[growls] I told you.







Ogres don't live happily ever after.







[screams]







Woo!







Ha!







[breathes deeply]







[gasping] Oh, Dad!







[sobbing]







- Is he...?

- Yup.







[croaking]







He croaked.







Harold?







Dad?







I'd hoped you'd never

see me like this.







- And he gave you a hard time!

- Donkey!







No, no, he's right.

I'm sorry.







To both of you.







I only wanted what

was best for Fiona.







But I can see now...







she already has it.







Shrek, Fiona...







Will you accept

an old frog's apologies...







and my blessing?







Harold?

I'm sorry, Lillian.







I just wish I could be

the man you deserve.







You're more that man today

than you ever were...







warts and all.

Midnight!







Fiona. Is this what you want?







To be this way forever?







- What?

- Because if you kiss me now...







we can stay like this.







You'd do that?







- For me?

- Yes.







I want what any princess wants.







To live happily ever after...







with the ogre I married.







Whatever happens,

I must not cry!







You cannot make me cry!

Whoa!







No. No, no.

Aaah! Ow.







Oh, no.







[sighs]







[laughs] Hey. You still look like

a noble steed to me.







[giggles] Now, where were we?







Oh. I remember.







[giggling]

            INT. MEDIEVAL TIMES THEATER - NIGHT

            A familiar beam of light shines down. The beam of light
            descends onto a stage. Lightning flashes to reveal Prince
            Charming riding his valiant steed Chauncey across the open
            plains. The wind blows back his golden mane.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Onward Chauncey, to the highest
             room of the tallest tower! Where
             my princess awaits rescue from her
             handsome Prince Charming.

            Lightning cracks. Thunder booms. Charming straddles a
            wooden hobby horse and gallops in place. A stage hand uses a
            bellow to blow air into Prince Charming's face. Another
            stage hand turns a crank that creates the moving background.
            In the orchestra, a man uses coconuts to create the sound
            effects of a galloping horse. Two more stage hands back
            stage create the cheap sound effects of thunder and
            lightning. A crudely constructed castle tower sits in front
            of a cheaply painted backdrop.

            The Fairytale Creatures are sitting at a table in the
            audience.

                            GINGERBREAD MAN
             This is worse than Love Letters! I
             hate dinner theatre.

                            PINOCCHIO
             Me too.

            Pinocchio's nose grows as he is caught in the lie.

            Prince Charming rides to the base of the tower.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Whoa there, Chauncey!

            He dismounts and sets his hobby horse on the ground. He
            strikes a dramatic pose.

            A Princess leans from a tower window.

                            ACTRESS
             Hark! The brave Prince Charming
             approach-ith.

            Prince Charming puffs his chest out.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 2.



                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Fear not fair maiden! I shall slay
             the monster that guards you and
             take my place as rightful King.

            An old couple at a table look confused.

                            OLD LADY
             (to old man)
             What did she say?

            Prince Charming glares as the bored audience largely ignores
            him.

            A man in a bad ogre costume comes onto the stage.

                            OGRE
             Grrrrrrr!

            The crowd erupts into applause. The Fairytale Creatures
            cheer.

                            FAIRYTALE CREATURES
                            (CHEERING)
             Woooo hoooo!!!

                            GINGERBREAD MAN
             Yea! Shrek!

            At first, Prince Charming is put off by the cheers for the
            Shrek-like beast. He pulls his sword and confronts the
            monster.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Prepare foul beast to enter into a
             world of pain with which you are
             not familiar!

            He is cut off as a waiter enters with a birthday cake.

                            WAITER
                            (SINGING)
             Happy Birthday to thee.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Do you mind?

            Prince Charming hops out of the way when a chair lands on
            stage. It slides past him and bumps into the tower facade.

                            GINGERBREAD MAN
             Do you mind? Bo-ring!
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 3.



            The audience laughs. Prince Charming glares at them and then
            tries to recover. He points his sword at the monster again.
            The tower facade starts to topple.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
                            (CLEARS THROAT)
             Prepare foul beast-

            Prince Charming looks over his shoulder and sees the facade
            falling. He cringes.

            The scenery slams against the stage, but Prince Charming is
            unharmed, perfectly framed in the princesses' window. The
            crowd laughs at the embarrassed Prince Charming. He shakes
            his mangled sword at the audience.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             (shaking his sword again)
             Someday you'll be sorry.

                            HECKLER
             (O.S.)
             We already are!

            They laugh again. Prince Charming throws down his sword,
            picks up his hobby horse and exits.

                            OGRE
             Grrrrrrr!

            The song and the laughter follow Prince Charming backstage.


            INT. BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

            Prince Charming walks through a tunnel backstage that leads
            to a door. The door has a star with his name written on it.
            He opens it.


            EXT. MEDIEVAL TIMES RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

            Prince Charming sits at his broken vanity and sobs. His make-
            shift dressing room is in an alley way next to the theater.

            Horses whinny as a carriage passes by. The castle of Far Far
            Away can be seen on the hill in the background. Prince
            Charming breaks down and cries.

            He looks up and sees a picture of the Fairy Godmother taped
            to the vanity. "Don't stop believing! Mommy's Little Angel"
            is written on the picture.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 4.



                            PRINCE CHARMING
                            (HEAVY SOBS)
             Oh mommy.

            He weeps again and then looks back at the picture. A
            determined change grows across his face.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Oh, you're right. I can't let this
             happen. I can't.

            Prince Charming looks at the castle on the hill. His
            expression hardens. He stands and faces the castle. He
            holds his chin up high.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             I am the rightful King of Far Far
             Away and I promise you this mother.
             I will restore dignity to my
             throne!

            A big gust of wind blows a newspaper page across his face.
            He peels it off and looks at the headline. His eyes tense
            and narrow.

             PRINCE CHARMING (CONT'D)
             And this time, no one will stand in
             my way!

            In the newspaper is a picture of Shrek and Fiona waving to a
            crowd.

            Prince Charming crumples up the newspaper in his fists.


            EXT. CASTLE - MORNING

            The camera booms down from the Far Far Away sign. The sun
            rises and the birds sing.


            INT. SHREK AND FIONA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

            The sun shines through the bedroom window as the camera pans
            over to Shrek and Fiona waking up.

                            SHREK
             Good morning.

                            FIONA
             Good morning.
                            (DREAMY)
             Oh... morning breath...
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 5.



            Shrek breathes in and smiles.

                            SHREK
                            (DREAMY)
             I know. Isn't it wonderful?

            The bedroom doors fly open and Donkey and the Dronkeys rush
            in. The Dronkeys head right for Shrek and Fiona. Shrek
            cowers beneath the bedclothes.

                            DONKEY
                            (SINGING)
             "Good morning! Good morning!"

            Shrek sinks further into the blankets as the Dronkeys
            exuberantly lick him. Fiona is amused.

            Donkey starts to sing "Good Morning" from Singin' in the Rain
            as he enters the room.

                            DONKEY
                            (SINGING)
             "The sun is shining through! Good
             morning! Good morning.
             (coming closer and closer
                            TO SHREK)
             "To you!"
                            (TO SHREK)
             "And you!"
                            (TO DRONKEY)
             And you!

            The Dronkeys fly out of the room, knocking down everything in
            their path.

                            DONKEY
             Oh, they grow up so fast.

            Shrek, greatly annoyed, lifts his hand and snuffs out a
            little fire on the bed left behind by the Dronkeys.

                            SHREK
             Not fast enough.

            Puss leaps onto the bed.

                            PUSS
             Okay. You have a very full day
             filling in for the King and Queen.
             There are several functions that
             require your attendance, sir.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 6.



                            SHREK
             Great! Let's get started.

            Shrek immediately pulls the covers up over his head and
            starts to snore.

                            DONKEY
             C'mon, lazy bones, time to get
             movin'!

            Donkey yanks the sheets off of Fiona and Shrek. He is
            surprised to see Shrek's bare legs.

                            DONKEY
             Aaahhh! You know you really need
             to get yourself a pair of jammies.

            Shrek sighs.

                            CUT TO:


            INT. KNIGHTING CEREMONY - DAY

            The camera pans down from a stained glass window. The song
            "Royal Pain" by the Eels plays in the background as the
            title: "Shrek The Third" is superimposed.

            A large crowd has gathered to watch the knighting. Shrek
            walks down the aisle of the church.

            Shrek walks up to the knight who seems a bit nervous.

            Shrek takes a sword from Puss, but he doesn't have any idea
            what he is supposed to do with it. Shrek looks at Puss, who
            indicates how to knight a person with his own sword. Shrek
            starts to knight the knight.

                            SHREK
             I knight thee...

            Shrek accidentally stabs the knight.

                            SHREK
             He-he. Ooh.

            The crowd, Fiona, Puss and Donkey look on, shocked.

             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 7.




            EXT. BOAT DOCKS - DAY

            Shrek and Fiona officiate at a boat christening for the Royal
            Navy.

            Shrek is holding a bottle of champagne. He leans on the
            boat, accidentally pushing it down the ramp. Shrek throws
            the bottle at the boat and it punches an enormous hole in the
            side of the hull. The boat quickly sinks.

            Shrek turns to find the patrons of Far Far Away shaking their
            heads as they leave.

                            CUT TO:


            INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY

            Raul, the make-up specialist, tightens some aprons around
            Shrek and Fiona. Donkey, Puss and Raul stand in front of
            them.

                            DONKEY
             Well, since you're filling in for
             one, you might as well look like a
             real King. Can somebody come in
             here and work on Shrek please?

            Raul stares at Shrek. Shrek raises his eyebrow.

                            RAUL
                            (AHEM)
             I will see what I can do.

            He unrolls a satchel full of different gardening tools.

            Suddenly Shrek's arms and legs are strapped into a chair.

            A man stands with his back to the camera and pulls on a rip
            cord as if he's holding a chain saw. VROOM! VROOM! He
            turns around to reveal a circular sander and starts to grind
            away at Shrek's gruesome toenails. Shrek cringes.

            We see a close-up of Shrek's eye. A mascara brush comes into
            frame and pulls at Shrek's eyelash.

            Fiona gets her nose hairs plucked.

                            FIONA
             Ow!
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 8.



            Lipstick is applied to some lips. The camera pulls back to
            reveal that the lips are Shrek's.

            A hand tries to tighten a zipper on Shrek's back. It keeps
            snagging on the skin until they finally rip it past and
            tighten up the zipper all the way.

            A small sock is placed onto Shrek's foot. With a shoe horn,
            Shrek's foot is shoved into a small shoe. POP!

            A collar is placed around Fiona's neck and her corset is
            tightened.

            A drill comes into frame and tightens the rivet on Shrek's
            belt. A mole is placed on his cheek.


            INT. BACKSTAGE - LATER

            REVEAL: Shrek and Fiona standing awkwardly in outrageous
            Renaissance outfits.

            Donkey gasps.

                            DONKEY
             Oh!

            Puss rolls his eyes.

                            PUSS
             Yeah, wow.

            Fiona is uncomfortable.

                            FIONA
             Uh, is this really necessary?

                            RAUL
                            (TO SHREK)
             Ho, ho. Quite necessary, Fiona.

                            SHREK
             I'm Shrek, you twit.

                            RAUL
             Whatever.

                            PUSS
             Okay peoples! This isn't a
             rehearsal. Let's see some hustle.

                            DONKEY
             Smiles everyone, smiles!
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 9.



            Off-screen, the Master of Ceremonies announces the couples
            arriving at the party.

            Fiona turns to Shrek and sees he is not in a good mood.

                            SHREK
             I don't know how much longer I can
             keep this up Fiona.

                            FIONA
             I'm sorry Shrek, but can you please
             just try to grin and bear it? It's
             just until Dad gets better.

            Shrek lets out another frustrated sigh.

                            FIONA
             Shrek?

                            SHREK
             Yeah.

                            FIONA
             You look handsome.

                            SHREK
             Ah. Come here, you.

            She gives him a supportive smile. He relaxes and smiles
            back.

            Fiona puckers up her lips and Shrek leans in for a kiss, but
            their bulky outfits prevent it.

            Shrek and Fiona let out a huge breath of air.

                            SHREK
             Oh, my butt is itching up a storm
             and I can't reach it in this monkey
             suit!

            Shrek tries to scratch his butt but to no avail.

                            SHREK
             Oh.
                            (WHISTLE)
             Hey you. Come here!

            A man holding a ruby scepter walks over to Shrek.

                            SHREK
             What's your name?
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 10.



                            FIDDLESWORTH
             Eh, Fiddlesworth, sir.

                            SHREK
             Hoo hoo hooo. Perfect.


            INT. BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS

            The announcer introduces Shrek and Fiona.

             MASTER OF CEREMONIES
             Ladies and gentlemen, Princess
             Fiona and Sir Shrek!

            The audience claps. The curtain starts to open.
            Fiddlesworth is scratching away at Shrek's butt.

                            SHREK
             You've done it. Oh, a little over
             to the left, yeah. That's great.

                            FIONA
             Uh Shrek?

            Fiddlesworth struggles to reach Shrek's itch. The crowd
            looks on in horror. Fiona tries to get his attention.

                            SHREK
             Ahh! All right, you got it...Oh
             yeah, you're on it. Oh that's it!
             Oh that's good!

                            FIONA
             Shrek...

                            SHREK
             Oh yeah! Scratch that thing! You
             got it. You're on it. That's
             great!

                            FIONA
             SHREK!

            Shrek and Fiddlesworth finally see the crowd. They both
            freeze. Shrek laughs nervously.

            Suddenly Shrek's belt buckle snaps off and hits Donkey in the
            eye. He stumbles through the crowd screaming.

                            DONKEY
             Ow!! My eye! My eye!
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 11.



            As he is stumbling, he grabs hold of a lady in the crowd.

                            WOMAN
             What are you doing?

            The woman pushes Donkey away. He falls, knocking over a
            guard holding an axe on his way down. The guard drops the
            axe. It flies past Puss, who is in the arms of a lady. The
            axe knocks over a vase. The vase flies up on stage and Fiona
            maneuvers to catch it. In flight, water spills out of the
            vase which causes Fiona to fall over.

            Shrek's tuxedo bib slaps him in the face. The clasp holding
            Shrek's pants up breaks off. Shrek stands on stage with his
            pants around his ankles. He shuffles towards Fiona.

                            SHREK
             Fiona!

            He trips over his pants and hits a loose wooden plank on the
            stage. The plank flings up and sends Fiddlesworth flying
            through the air where his jacket slips over a banner pole,
            trapping him.

                            FIDDLESWORTH
             Uhhh...
                            (WIMPER)

            Shrek has reached Fiona who is still lying on the floor.

                            SHREK
             Are you okay?

                            FIONA
             Yeah. I'm fine.

            Fiona's eyes suddenly widen.

            Fiddlesworth's jacket rips and he falls onto a waiter
            carrying flaming skewers.

                            FIDDLESWORTH
             Ahhhh!

            The skewers fly through the air. Donkey stands up in frame
            with one eye half shut. The flaming skewers shoot by him and
            land in the curtains, setting them on fire. He blows one of
            the skewers out and takes a bite.

                            DONKEY
             Oh! Shrimp! My favorite.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 12.



            The fire causes a Far Far Away shield to detach from a wooden
            ceiling beam and fall onto the stage, breaking it in half.

            The whole stage collapses in the middle. The buffet tables
            slide toward Shrek and Fiona at the other end and collide.

            CRASH! BANG!

             CUT TO BLACK:


            INT. SHREK AND FIONA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

            The door to Fiona's room flies open.

                            SHREK
             That's it! We're leaving!

            Shrek storms in pulling bits of buffet food off his face.

                            FIONA
             Honey, please calm down...

            Shrek grabs the wig off of his head and throws it aside.

                            SHREK
             Calm down? Who do you think we're
             kidding? I am an ogre! I'm not cut
             out for this, Fiona and I never
             will be.

            Shrek wipes off his makeup with his shirt sleeve and flings
            his shirt to the floor. He falls onto the bed next to
            Donkey.

                            DONKEY
             I think that went pretty well.

            Shrek startles.

                            SHREK
             Donkey!

            Shrek picks him up and throws him out the door.

                            DONKEY
             Aww, come on now Shrek!

            Shrek slams the door shut.

            Shrek turns back towards the bed and sees Puss reclining on
            his pillow.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 13.



                            PUSS
             Some people just don't understand
             boundaries.

            Shrek picks Puss up by the scruff of his neck and tosses him
            outside the window. He shuts it. Puss sits sadly on the
            ledge, giving Shrek his sad-eyes routine. Shrek draws the
            blinds.

            Shrek stomps over and falls back onto the bed. Fiona tries
            to calm him down.

                            FIONA
             Just think... a couple more days,
             and we'll be back home in our
             vermin-filled shack, strewn with
             fungus, filled with the rotting
             stench of mud and neglect.

            This thought calms him. Shrek takes in a long, deep breath
            and exhales. He smiles.

                            SHREK
             Oh, you had me at "vermin-filled."

                            FIONA
             And, uh... maybe even the pitter-
             patter of little feet on the
             floor...?

                            SHREK
                            (LAUGHS)
             That's right. The swamp rats will
             be spawning.

                            FIONA
             Uh, no... you know, what I was
             thinking of is a little bit bigger
             than a swamp rat.

                            SHREK
             Donkey?

                            FIONA
             No, Shrek. Um... what if -
                            THEORETICALLY -

                            SHREK
             Yeah?

                            FIONA
             They were little ogre feet?
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 14.



                            SHREK
             Oh.
                            (NERVOUS LAUGH)

            Shocked, Shrek falls off the bed.

            He slowly emerges from behind the bed.

                            SHREK
             Honey? Let's try and be rational
             about this. Have you seen a baby
             lately? They just eat and poop and
             they cry and then they cry when
             they poop and they poop when they
             cry...Now, imagine an ogre baby.
             They extra cry and they extra poop.

                            FIONA
             Shrek.

            She grabs his hands and looks deeply into his eyes.

                            FIONA
             Don't you ever think about having a
             family?

            Shrek takes her hand.

                            SHREK
             Right now, you're my family.

            There is a knock on the bedroom door. The door bursts open,
            revealing a Royal Page.

            Shrek springs up.

                            SHREK
             Well, somebody better be dying.

                            CUT TO:


            INT. KING'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

            The camera pushes through a corridor that leads to the King's
            bedroom. The King is lying on his lily pad, coughing.

                            KING HAROLD
             I'm dying.

            The King inhales and launches into a violent coughing fit.
            Shrek looks a bit guilty about his last admission. The Queen
            comes to the King's aid and he settles down.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 15.



                            QUEEN
             Harold.

                            KING HAROLD
             Don't forget to pay the gardener,
             Lillian.

            The Queen is used to these kind of non-sequiturs.

                            QUEEN
             Of course darling.

            The King suppresses a few coughs. He turns to his daughter.

                            KING HAROLD
             Fiona...

                            FIONA
             Yes Daddy?

                            KING HAROLD
             I know I've made many mistakes with
             you.

                            FIONA
             It's okay.

                            KING HAROLD
             But your love for Shrek has taught
             me so much.

            Fiona smiles. The King addresses Shrek.

                            KING HAROLD
             My dear boy, I am proud to call you
             my son.

                            SHREK
             And I'm proud to call you my
             Frog... King Dad in-law.

            Shrek smiles.

                            KING HAROLD
             Now, there is a matter of business
             to attend tooo...

            The King starts wheezing and coughing. Eventually he stops.
            They think he's dead. Puss solemnly removes his hat.

                            PUSS
             The Frog King is dead.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 16.



            Fiona starts crying. The King suddenly wakes up, coughing.

                            DONKEY
                            (TO PUSS)
             Put your hat back on, fool.

                            KING HAROLD
             Shrek, please come hither.

            Fiona gives Shrek a look. Shrek walks over to the King.

                            SHREK
             Yeah, Dad?

                            KING HAROLD
             This Kingdom needs a new king. You
             and Fiona are next in line for the
             throne.

                            SHREK
             Ooo. Next in line. Now you see
             Dad, that's why people love you.
             Even on your deathbed you're still
             making jokes.

            The King stares at Shrek, stone-faced. Shrek leans in
            closer.

                            SHREK
             Oh, come on Dad...an Ogre as King?
             I don't think that's such a good
             idea. There's got to be somebody
             else. Anybody?

                            KING HAROLD
             Aside from you there is only one
             remaining heir.

            Shrek brightens.

                            SHREK
             Really!? Who is he, Dad?

                            KING HAROLD
             His name is... is... is...

                            SHREK
             What's his name? What's his name?

                            KING HAROLD
             ...is ...
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 17.



            Shrek leans in closer after each "is," waiting in
            anticipation. The King starts to hyperventilate.

                            FIONA
             Daddy!

            The King is dead. A fly comes out of his mouth and flies
            away.

            Puss starts to take his hat off. The fly buzzes into frame.
            A tongue catches it. Puss puts his hat back on.

                            KING HAROLD
             (chewing the fly)
             His name is Arthur.

                            SHREK
             Arthur?

                            KING HAROLD
                            (COUGH)
             I know you'll do what's...
                            (EXHALING)
             riiiight...

            He succumbs. The King really is dead now.

                            QUEEN
             Harold!?

                            SHREK
             Dad? Dad? Dad?

            Donkey bows his head.

                            DONKEY
             Do your thing, man.

            Puss takes his hat off.

            Fiona starts to cry and hugs Shrek. The weight of the King's
            request hits Shrek. He is in a state of shock.

            We hold a moment on the Queen, Shrek, Fiona, Puss and Donkey
            to let the King's passing sink in.

            EXT. RODEO DRIVE - CONTINUOUS

            The streets of Far Far Away are empty. People are closing up
            the shops on Rodeo Drive.

                            DISSOLVE TO:

            The knights of Far Far Away march toward the castle as the
            flag is lowered to half-masked.


            EXT. POND - LATER

            Close on a statue of the late King. Shrek, Fiona, the Queen,
            and all the Fairy-tale Creatures and Princesses have gathered
            for the funeral. The Queen sets an old shoe box ("Ye Olde
            Footlocker") on top of a lily pad and sends it floating out
            into the water.

            An overhead shot shows the box floating through the lily
            pads. The camera tilts up to reveal a frog choir, singing
            "Live and Let Die." The Princesses, Donkey, Puss and the
            Fairy-tale Creatures all bow their heads solemnly.

            Shrek puts his arm around Fiona.

            The funeral has ended and the crowd begins to disperse.
            Shrek, Fiona and the Queen stand by the pond. The Queen
            sadly gazes at the pond.

            The camera pulls back to reveal a cloaked figure, on
            horseback, overlooking the funeral. The figure removes his
            hood to reveal Prince Charming. He gives a smug smile, and
            rides off.

                            CUT TO:


            EXT. POISONED APPLE BAR - NIGHT

            Prince Charming rides up to the Poison Apple Bar.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 19.




            INT. POISONED APPLE BAR - CONTINUOUS

            Smoke wafts through the screen. The camera pans down to the
            top of a piano where an ashtray with a lit cigarette burns
            and a brandy sifter is filled with coins. The camera pans
            over to a Singing Witch who turns around to reveal a
            microphone in her hand. The Singing Witch starts to sing
            "I've Never Been To Me" by Nancy Wilson.

            The bar is filled with various Fairy-tale Villains. Two
            pirates sit forlornly with their mugs. The Puppet Master
            takes a drink out of a beer mug. He is surrounded by a bunch
            of empty beer mugs.

            Prince Charming enters the bar.

            A group is gathered around Cyclops riding a medieval
            mechanical bull, hooting and hollering. The bull stops and
            the Villains turn to look at Prince Charming.

            Prince Charming hangs his cape on a tree branch. The camera
            adjusts right to reveal the branch is actually one of the
            Evil Trees, who flings the cape to the floor. Everyone takes
            notice as Prince Charming walks through. Little Red Riding
            Hood is sitting on a pile of books at a table. Evil Dwarves
            glare in Prince Charming's direction. Prince Charming walks
            by a pair of witches (one is the Evil Queen from Snow White)
            playing pool. The Evil Queen scratches when she sees him and
            the pool ball goes flying into the Headless Horseman's neck.
            Prince Charming walks by the singing witch. He reaches the
            bar, pulls out a handkerchief, places it over the bar stool,
            and sits.

            Prince Charming spots the bartender with her back to him. He
            clears his throat.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             What does a Prince have to do to
             get a drink around here?

            Mabel, the other ugly stepsister, rises up in front a poster
            with a smiling beer wench.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Ah Mabel, why they call you an ugly
             stepsister I'll never know.

            He winks at her. She glares at him.

             She's not welcome here and neither
             are you.

            She spits into the mug and wipes it with a towel.

                            MABEL (CONT'D)
             What do you want, Charming?

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Oh not much, just a chance at
             redemption...
                            (LAUGHS)
             And a Fuzzy Navel.

            Prince Charming stands up and turns to the bar patrons.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             And Fuzzy Navels for all my
             friends!

            Captain Hook rips his hook across the piano keys. The
            singing witch bares her teeth. The witches break their pool
            cues. The Puppet Master breaks his beer mug.

                            CAPTAIN HOOK
             We're not your friends.

            Prince Charming grows nervous.

            The Villains all approach Prince Charming.

            From behind the bar, Mabel grabs Prince Charming by his
            shoulders and pins him on top of the bar.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Ahh!

            Captain Hook places his hook against Prince Charming's neck.

                            CAPTAIN HOOK
             You don't belong here.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             You're right; oh, I mean you're
             absolutely right, but I mean, do
             any of us?

                            CYCLOPS
             Do a number on his face!
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 21.



                            PRINCE CHARMING
             No, no, wait, wait, wait! We are
             more alike than you think.

            Prince Charming turns to the Evil Queen.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Wicked Witch. The Seven Dwarves
             saved Snow White and then what
             happened?

                            EVIL QUEEN
             Oh, what's it to you?

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             They left you the un-fairest of
             them all. And now here you are,
             hustling pool to get your next
             meal. How does that feel?

                            EVIL QUEEN
             Pretty unfair.

            Prince Charming begins to work the crowd.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             And you? Your star puppet abandons
             the show to go and find his father.

                            PUPPET MASTER
             I hate that little wooden puppet.

            Prince Charming turns to Captain Hook.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             And Hook...

            Prince Charming looks down at the hook.

             PRINCE CHARMING (CONT'D)
             ... Need I say more?

            Captain Hook backs off, feeling insecure about his appendage.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             And you! Frumpypigskin.

                            RUMPLESTILTSKIN
             Rumplestiltskin.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Where's that first-born you were
             promised, hey?
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 22.



            Rumplestiltskin caresses a pacifier tattoo on his forearm.

            Prince Charming gains more confidence as he confronts Mabel.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Mabel, remember how you couldn't
             get your little fat foot into that
             tiny glass slipper?

            Mabel sighs.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Cinderella is in Far Far Away right
             now, eating Bon Bons, cavorting
             with every little last Fairy-tale
             Creature that has ever done you
             wrong.

            Prince Charming now has everyone's attention.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Once upon a time, someone decided
             that we were the losers. But there
             are two sides to every story. And
             our side has not been told.

            The crowd listens, rapt.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             So who will join me? Who wants to
             come out on top for once? Who
             wants their happily ever after?!

            The crowd of villains cheer and starts getting rowdy. A bar
            room brawl ensues. Prince Charming looks on, shocked. He
            ducks out of the way of a flying liquor bottle. He smiles
            nervously and lifts his fruity, Fuzzy Navel to drink.

                            CUT TO:


            EXT. DOCKS - DUSK

            The camera booms down from the lighthouse.

                            BLIND MOUSE #1
             This way gents.

            The blind mice stumble and fall trying to get down the steps
            to the dock. The Fairy-tale Creatures and Dragon have
            gathered to wish Shrek, Puss and Donkey a bon voyage as they
            set off to retrieve Arthur.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 23.



            On the docks, two Dronkeys chase a seagull as the camera pans
            over to Puss who breaks free of the embrace of a lady cat.

                            PUSS
             It's out of my hands senorita, the
             winds of fate have blown on my
             destiny. But I will never forget
             you. You are the love of my life.

            Off-screen, a cat meows and walks towards Puss.

                            PUSS (CONT'D)
             As are you...

            Camera pulls out to reveal more and more cats approaching
            Puss.

                            PUSS (CONT'D)
             And you.

            Puss starts walking away as two of the cats begin to engage
            in a cat fight. They are hissing at each other as Puss backs
            away from them and into another.

                            PUSS (CONT'D)
             And, uh... hi. I don't know you,
             but I'd like to. I gotta go.

            Puss runs out of frame. Cut to Dragon, who is talking to
            Donkey. Puss runs past them in the background. Dragon lets
            out a soft wail.

                            DONKEY
             I know, I know... I don't want to
             leave you either baby, but you know
             how Shrek is. The dude's lost
             without me.

            She gives him an understanding smile.

                            DONKEY
             But don't worry. I'll send you
             airmail kisses everyday!

            He blows her a kiss and she catches it. He looks down at his
            children, holding back tears.

                            DONKEY
             Alright, be strong babies! Be
             strong. Now, Coco, Peanut, you
             listen to Mama, alright? And
             Bananas, no more roastin'
             marshmallows on your sister's head.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 24.



            Bananas lets out a fiery sneeze.

                            DONKEY
             Ah, that's my special boy. Oh,
             come over here, all of you. Give
             your Daddy a big hug!

            The baby Dronkeys fly around their Daddy.

            The Dronkey that Fiona is holding flies off to join Donkey
            and the others.

            Fiona nervously takes in a breath.

                            FIONA
             Shrek, maybe you should just stay
             and be King.

                            SHREK
             Oh, c'mon, there's no way I could
             ever run a kingdom. That's why your
             cousin Arthur's the perfect choice.

                            FIONA
             It's not that. No. It's, you
             see...

                            SHREK (CONT'D)
             And if he gives me any trouble,
             I've always got persuasion and
             reason.
             (holds up his right fist)
             Here's persuasion,
             (holds up his left fist)
             and here's reason.

            Shrek chuckles. Fiona gives him a look. Shrek reassures her.

                            SHREK
             Fiona, soon it's just gonna be you
             and me and our swamp.

                            FIONA
                            (HESITANT)
             It's not going to be just you and
             me.

            The ship's fog horn sounds.

                            SHIP CAPTAIN
             All aboard!
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 25.



                            SHREK
             It will be. I promise. I love
             you.

            He kisses her and joins Puss and Donkey on the boat.

            He title proudly reads: H.R.M CRUSHING RESPONSIBILITY II

            The boat sets sail. The Dronkeys spell out "We Love You
            Daddy" with smoke in the sky.

                            FAIRYTALE CREATURES
             Awwwwwwwww!

                            PIG #1
             That's lovely.

            Donkey waves to his kids, sobs.

                            DONKEY
             Bye bye babies!

            Fiona runs after the boat.

                            FIONA
             Shrek!

            Shrek leans against the rail, calling out to her.

                            SHREK
             Yeah?

                            FIONA
             Wait!

                            SHREK
             What is it?

            She smiles and takes a deep breath.

                            FIONA
             I'm, I'm-

            The Ship Captain blows a fog horn and cuts her off. Shrek
            smiles back at her.

                            SHREK
                            (LAUGHS)
             I love you too honey!

                            FIONA
             No... No, I said I'm pr-
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 26.



            The Ship Captain starts to blow again. Shrek grabs the horn
            and throws it overboard.

                            SHREK
             You're what?!

                            FIONA
             I said I'm pregnant!

            The Fairy-tale Creatures behind Fiona cheer.

                            SHREK
             (doesn't want to believe
                            HIS EARS)
             Uh... what was that?

                            FIONA
             You're going to be a father!

                            SHREK
                            (NERVOUS LAUGH)
             That's great.

                            FIONA
             Really? I'm glad you think so! I
             love you.

            Shrek smiles back at Fiona.

                            SHREK
             Yeah...
                            (NERVOUS LAUGH)
             Me too... you...

            Fiona smiles as the Queen places a hand on her shoulder.

            Overjoyed at the news, Donkey pops up onto the railing.

                            DONKEY
             I'm gonna be an Uncle. I'm gonna
             be an Uncle! I'm gonna be an
             Uncle!

                            PUSS
             Oh, and you my friend are royally--

            The fog horn blasts again as the boat disappears into the
            fog.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 27.




            EXT. BOAT CABIN - NIGHT

            The boat travels along in the open sea. Shrek is fast asleep
            as the boat travels through an estuary and beaches itself.

            Shrek wakes up. He opens the cabin door.

                            SHREK
             Ahhh. Home.

            He smiles to himself. The boat has beached itself right
            outside of Shrek's swamp house.

            He leaps off the boat.

                            SHREK
             Woohoo!


            EXT. SWAMP HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

            Shrek takes a deep breath of swamp air.

                            SHREK
             Ahh.

            He skips and dances happily toward his house.

             FIONA (O.S.)
             Shrek!?

                            SHREK
             Ooo.
                            (LAUGHS)


            INT. SWAMP HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

            He sashays through the front door with his eyes closed,
            presenting himself.

                            SHREK
             Fiona!

            After a moment of silence, he opens his eyes, realizing that
            Fiona is not there.

                            SHREK
             Fiona?

            He looks around the room, puzzled. The door slams closed
            behind him.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 28.


            A baby carriage rolls slowly into frame behind him. He turns
            slowly and sees the baby carriage covered with a blanket.
            Shrek removes the blanket, revealing a baby ogre, smiling
            innocently at him.

                            SHREK
             Huh? Oh no.

            The baby burps.

                            SHREK
                            (AMUSED)
             Better out than in, I always say.
             Ha ha!

                            OGRE BABY
             Hiccup!

            This time the baby's burp turns into projectile vomit aimed
            directly at Shrek. Shrek puts his hand up to block the
            vomit, but to no avail. The baby continues to vomit, but
            eventually stops after completely soiling himself and Shrek.
            The baby looks like it's about to cry. Shrek raises his
            hands.

                            SHREK
             No, no, no, no, no, no. Ha, ha.
             It's okay. It's gonna be alright.

            Shrek picks the baby up, smiling at it cautiously. He holds
            it awkwardly for a few seconds, then looks up and realizes
            that his house is filled with babies.

                            OGRE BABY
             Da-Da!

            Babies roll around his living room, tearing the fabric off
            his chair. The chair reclines, catapulting one of the babies
            onto Shrek's head. A standing lamp with a baby on top falls,
            and Shrek dives to catch him. Another baby is pulling the
            tablecloth, causing lethal knives to fly straight at him.
            Shrek snatches the baby away just before he is impaled. One
            of the babies strikes a match near the fireplace. Shrek runs
            over, picks up the baby and blows out the match. He takes a
            baby out of the cauldron.

                            SHREK
             Hey! Hey, hey, wait! Would ya?
             No, no. Stop! Hey, hey, hey. No.

            Shrek panics. A baby is knocking glass jars off the shelf.
            Shrek catches him before he crawls off of it. Shrek runs
            through the room picking up babies.

            INT. SHREK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

            After he has collected as many babies as he can, Shrek slides
            open the curtain to his bedroom.

                            SHREK
             Huh?

            He sees a baby sitting in his bed, smiling up at him. The
            baby shrugs.

                            OGRE BABY
             Bubabatoo?

            Suddenly, Shrek hears a loud rumble. He turns around.
            Babies start pouring out of the window and the fireplace.
            First there is one, then two, then thirty more follow.
            Hundreds of them start piling in.

            Shrek makes a run for the doorway, but no matter how hard he
            runs, the doorway keeps getting farther and farther away! He
            keeps trying, hundreds of babies trailing behind.


            INT. GRADUATION STAGE - CONTINUOUS

            Finally, Shrek reaches the door and opens it. He slams it
            shut behind him and closes his eyes. Everything is quiet.
            He opens his eyes and finds himself on stage in front of his
            high school.

            Shrek looks up to find a graduation cap on his head. The
            audience is full of ogre babies laughing at him. The camera
            pulls back to reveal Shrek standing at the podium, naked.

             Ahhhh! Oh, Donkey! Donkey, wake-
             up!

            Donkey and Puss turn around, but they both have baby-ogre
            faces! Donkey makes a baby noise. As the camera zooms in,
            Donkey's eyes glow red and his teeth become sharp and pointy.

            A fog horn blows. Shrek bolts upright again. Donkey and
            Puss wake up.

                            SHREK
             Ahhhh!

            He breaths heavily, trying to compose himself.

                            DONKEY
             Shrek. Shrek, are you okay?

                            SHREK
             Oh... I can't believe I'm going to
             be a father.

            Donkey and Puss look at each other. He gets up and walks to
            the ship's railing.

                            SHREK
             How did this happen?

                            PUSS
             Allow me to explain. You see, when
             a man has certain feelings for a
             woman, a powerful urge sweeps over
             him...

                            SHREK
             I know how it happened. I just
             can't believe it.

            Shrek walks away.

            Donkey leans over to Puss.

             How does it happen?

            Puss rolls his eyes at Donkey.

            Donkey sees Shrek at the back of the boat staring out at the

             Donkey, can you just cut to the
             part where you're supposed to make
             me feel better?

            Shrek slumps against the rail. Puss hops up on the railing
            and whispers into Shrek's other ear.

                            PUSS
             You know I love Fiona, Boss.
             Right?
                            (CONFIDENTIALLY)
             But what I'm talking about here is
             you, me, my cousin's boat, an ice-
             cold pitcher of mojitos, and two
             weeks of nothing but fishing.

            Puss makes a "let's go fishing" gesture by casting an
            imaginary rod into the ocean. Donkey is right there to
            whisper in Shrek's other ear.

                            DONKEY
             Man, don't you listen to him.
             Having a baby is not going to ruin
             your life.

                            SHREK
             It's not my life I'm worried about
             ruining. It's the kid's.

            Donkey and Puss pause as Shrek rants.

                            SHREK
             I mean...when have you ever heard
             the phrase "as sweet as an...ogre"
             or "as nurturing as...an ogre" Or

                            SHREK
             That's true.

            He thinks for a moment.

             I'm doomed.

             Uh, with your journey.

            He points to shore. A majestic castle stands proudly on a

            A horse whinnies behind them. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss jump
            out of the way as a medieval school bus storms by. The kids
            on the back of the bus scream when they see Shrek.

                            DONKEY
             What in the shista-shire kind of
             place is this?

            Shrek suddenly looks concerned.

             Well, my stomach aches and my palms
             just got sweaty. Must be a high

            Shrek rolls his eyes and continues on, terrifying students as
            he walks through the courtyard.

             Ahhhhh!

            The kid runs away quickly into the student parking lot where
            a bunch of different style horse-drawn carriages are parked.
            A carriage passes in front of Shrek that reads: "Caution -

            Shrek, Donkey and Puss arrive to see the beginning of the
            charge. It's an exciting back and forth.

            Hooves pound on sand.

            Shrek looks back at the victorious Knight. He removes his
            helmet revealing a strong handsome face. The Knight enjoys

            gallops off. The Knight looks up at Shrek in fear.

                            SHREK (CONT'D)
             Greetings your majesty. This is
             your lucky day.

                            KNIGHT (LANCELOT)
             So what for like are you supposed
             to be? Some kind of giant mutant
             leprechaun or something?

                            SHREK
             Oh, ho, ho, ho. Giant mutant
             leprechaun... You made a funny.

            Shrek scoops up the Knight, tosses him over his shoulder,
            ogre-style.

                            KNIGHT (LANCELOT)
             Unhand me, monster!

                            SHREK
             Stop squirming, Arthur.

                            KNIGHT (LANCELOT)
             I'm not Arthur!

            Shrek stops and holds Lancelot above his head. Lancelot
            tries to regain his dignity.

                            LANCELOT
             I am Lancelot.

            Lancelot points across the school yard.

                            LANCELOT
             That dork over there is Arthur!

            He points to the TEENAGE ARTHUR, skulking away across the
            school yard.

                            SHREK
             Hey!

            Artie turns his head briefly, but keeps on walking.

            Shrek sighs and dumps Lancelot to the ground.

                            LANCELOT
             Aaah.

            Shrek storms off towards the school. Puss and Donkey catch
            up. One of the female students steps in front of Shrek.

                            GUINEVERRE
             Ahem! This is like totally
             embarrassing, but my friend Tiffany
             thinkest thou vex her so soothly...

            The other girls giggle.

                            GUINEVERRE
             And she thought perchance thou
             would wanna ask her to the
             Homecoming Dance or something...

                            SHREK
             Uh, excuse me?

                            GUINEVERRE
             It's like whatever. She's just
             totally into college guys and
             mythical creatures and stuff.

            She pops her gum.

            INT. HALLWAY - LATER

            Shrek and Puss search the hallways, looking for Artie.

                            SHREK
             Oh Arthur! Come out, come out
             wherever you are...

            Off-screen we hear mumbling from inside a locker. Shrek and
            Puss look as Donkey pushes the locker door open. He has been
            stuffed inside. Off-screen we hear some students laughing.

                            DONKEY
             Yeah, you better run, you little
             punk no good-niks, `cause the days
             of "Little Donkey Dumpy Drawers"
             are over!

            An "I Suck-eth" sign has been taped Donkey's butt.

            Shrek spots students entering the Gymnasium. They approach a
            HALL MONITOR who stops them.

                            HALL MONITOR

             Hold it...

            Two mascot costumed students walk up to the hall monitor.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 39.



                            COSTUME STUDENT 1
             We're here for the Mascot Contest.

                            COSTUME STUDENT 2
             Grrrrr!

            The Hall Monitor waves them in. Shrek gets an idea.

                            SHREK
             (pleased with himself)
             We're here for the Mascot Contest
             too.

            The Hall Monitor reaches out and starts painfully pinching
            and pulling Shrek's skin. Shrek tries to hide the pain.

                            HALL MONITOR
                            (SUSPICIOUS)
             This is a costume?

                            SHREK
                            (RECOVERING)
             Aaaiyyyy... worked on it all night
             long!

            The Hall Monitor lets his face snap back into place. Shrek
            struggles not to scream in agony. Hall Monitor is still
            suspicious.

                            HALL MONITOR
             Looks pretty real to me.

                            PUSS
             If it were real could I do this?

            Puss's claws snap out one at a time like jack-knives and then
            Puss jabs all the claws deep into Shrek's butt.

                            DONKEY
             Or this?

            Donkey kicks Shrek hard in the groin with his hind legs.
            Shrek winces and sweats.

                            SHREK
                            (UNBELIEVABLY STRAINED)
             He's right! If it were real that
             would have been agonizingly
             painful!

                            DONKEY
             Now watch this....

             That's quite enough boys.


            INT. GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS

            Principal Pynchley presides over an assembly for the entire
            student body. He speaks through a megaphone.

                            PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
             Thank you to Professor Primbottom
             for his invigorating lecture on how
             to just say "nay".

            Two students are standing next to Pynchley. One is dressed
            up like a dragon and the other as a griffin.

                            PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
             And now, without further ado, let's
             give a warm Worcestershire-hoozah
             to the winner of our "New Mascot"
             contest... the--

            Shrek bursts through the double-doors of the gym.

             PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY (CONT'D)
             --ogre?

            The students gasp as Shrek marches forward.

                            SHREK
             That's right. I'm the new mascot.
             So let's really try and beat the
             other guys... at whatever it is
             they're doing.

            The band plays Smashmouth's "Rock Star."

                            PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
             This is indeed all a bit
             unorthodox.

            Without breaking stride, Shrek grabs Principal Pynchley's
            megaphone.

                            SHREK
             Now, where can I find Arthur
             Pendragon?
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 41.



            The students all point... to the basketball hoop, where Artie
            hangs helplessly. Shrek, Donkey and Puss turn and look up
            and see the freshly wedgied student. The students laugh.

            In the front row, Lancelot bumps fists with Bohort.

                            LANCELOT
             Classic.

            Donkey turns to Lancelot.

                            DONKEY
             You should be ashamed of yourself.

                            LANCELOT
             I didn't do it. They did.

            Lance points to the D&D nerds. They are beside themselves
            with nasal laughter. Nosebleed boy starts bleeding again.

            Shrek reaches up and pulls Artie down to eye level.

                            ARTIE
             Please don't eat me.

                            STUDENTS
                            (CHANTING)
             Eat him! Eat him!

            Even Principal Pynchley gets caught up in the excitement.

                            PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
             Eat him!
            Shrek yanks on Artie and pulls him off the hoop.

                            SHREK
             I'm not here to eat him.

                            STUDENTS
             AWWW.

                            SHREK
             It's time to pack up your
             toothbrush and jammies. You're the
             new King of Far Far Away.

                            ARTIE
             What?

            The students react with surprise and disbelief.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 42.



                            LANCELOT
             Artie a King? More like the Mayor
             of Loserville.

                            BOHORT
             Nice one Lance!

            They high five. The tuba player plays a Wha-wha-wha.

                            LANCELOT
             Burn.

            Everyone laughs.

                            ARTIE
             Is this for real?

                            SHREK
             Absolutely. Now clean out your
             locker, kid. You've got a kingdom
             to run.

                            ARTIE
             So wait, I'm really the only heir?

            Shrek pauses for just a moment, then...

                            SHREK
             The one and only.

                            ARTIE
             Give me just a second.

            Artie turns back to the crowd and delivers a heartfelt
            speech.

                            ARTIE
             My good people, I think there's a
             lesson here for all of us. Maybe
             the next time you're about to dunk
             a kid's head in a chamber pot,
             you'll stop and think, hey, maybe
             this guy has feelings. Maybe I
             should cut him some slack. Because
             maybe, just maybe... this guy's
             gonna turn out to be, uh...I
             dunno...a King! And maybe his
             first royal decree will be to
             banish everyone who ever picked on
             him -- that's right, I'm looking at
             you, jousting team.

            Artie points and Lancelot and his buddies look horrified.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 43.



                            ARTIE
             And Gwen... oh Gwen. I've always
             loved you.

                            GUINEVERRE
             Ew.

                            ARTIE
             Well good friends, it breaks my
             heart, but, enjoy your stay here in
             prison while I rule the free world
             baby!

                            SHREK
             Alright, let's not overdo it.

                            ARTIE
             I'm building my city people! On
             Rock and Roll!

                            SHREK
             You just overdid it.

            Shrek shoves the kid through the door.

                            ARTIE
             Ow!

            Shrek, Donkey, and Puss exit the gymnasium.

                            CUT TO:


            INT. LIBRARY - DAY

            All the Princesses and Fairy-tale Creatures have gathered for
            Fiona's baby shower. A group of birds gently place a
            flowered wreath on Fiona's head. The Princesses all gaze at
            her.

                            PRINCESSES
                            (GASP)
             Oh!

                            SNOW WHITE
             Look at you!

                            RAPUNZEL
             Wow!

                            SNOW WHITE
             You look darling!
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 44.



                            SLEEPING BEAUTY
             Just precious! Look at her!

                            RAPUNZEL
             So, have you had any cravings since
             you've been pregnant?

            Fiona stands at the buffet table, stuffing her face with
            cakes, pies, and anything else she can get her hands on.

                            FIONA
                            (MOUTH FULL)
             No, no, not at all.

            She takes another bite.

                            FIONA
             Do you smell ham?

                            SNOW WHITE
                            (SINGING)
             Oooh! It's present time!

            The birds and forest creatures all flock to Snow White. They
            chirp and hoot happily. Snow White looks annoyed.

                            CINDERELLA
             Oh, Fiona, won't you please open
             mine first? It's the one in front.

            Fiona reads the card.

                            FIONA
                            (READING)
             "Congratulations on your new mess
             maker..." Oh, `mess maker.'
                            (LAUGHS)
             "Hopefully this helps. Love,
             Cinderella."

            Fiona opens it and pulls out a plastic baggy and pooper-
            scooper.

                            PRINCESSES
             Oooo! Aaaah!

                            DORIS
             Will you look at that!

             What is it?

                            CINDERELLA
             It's for the poopies.

                            SLEEPING BEAUTY
             Eww. Wait, babies poop?

                            RAPUNZEL
             Everyone poops Beauty.

            The Fairy-tale Creatures get excited.

             he wasn't.

            Gingerbread Man continues to sing his "Lollipop Song."

                            PIG #1
             Oh, enough! Shrek went off to
             bring back the next heir! Oh!

            The pig realizes his admission and immediately covers his
            mouth. Pinocchio laughs nervously.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             He's bringing back the next heir?

                            PINOCCHIO
             No!

            Pinocchio's nose grows.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Hook! Get rid of this new "King."

                            CAPTAIN HOOK
             Right!

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             But bring Shrek to me. I have
             something special in mind for him.

                            PINOCCHIO
             He'll never fall for your tricks!

            Pinocchio's nose grows again.

                            WOLF
             Oh boy.

                            CUT TO:


            EXT. BOAT DECK - DUSK

            The boat cuts through the open sea. Artie smiles as he
            watches Worcestershire shrinking away on the horizon.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 55.



                            ARTIE
             I can't believe it... me a King?
             I...I mean I knew I came from
             royalty and all, but I just figured
             everyone forgot about me.

            He looks out to sea, disbelieving.

                            SHREK
             Oh no, in fact, the King asked for
             you personally.

            Artie smiles.

                            ARTIE
             Really? Wow! Look, I know it's not
             all gonna be fun and games.

                            SHREK
             It really is all fun and games,
             actually. Sure, you have to knight
             a few heroes, launch a ship or two.
             By the way, make sure you hit the
             boat just right with the bottle.

                            ARTIE
             Boat with the bottle? Any idiot
             can hit a boat with a bottle.

            Shrek chuckles sheepishly.

                            SHREK
             Well, I've heard it's harder than
             it looks.

                            ARTIE
             Whoa!! This is gonna be huge.
             Parties, princesses, castles...
             princesses.

                            DONKEY
             It's gonna be great, Artie. You'll
             be living in the lap of luxury.
             They got the finest chefs around
             waiting for you to place your
             order.

            Puss jumps up onto the railing next to Artie.

                            PUSS
             And fortunately you'll have the
             royal food tasters.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 56.



                            ARTIE
                            (INTRIGUED))
             Oh yeah? What do they do?

                            PUSS
             They taste the food before the King
             eats, to make sure it's not
             poisoned.

                            ARTIE
             Poisoned?

            Shrek senses trouble and immediately steps in.

                            SHREK
             Or too salty!

            Shrek turns to Puss and Donkey, trying to shut them up.

                            DONKEY
                            (TO ARTIE)
             Don't worry about it. You'll be
             safe and sound with the help of
             your body guards.

                            ARTIE
             Body guards?

                            PUSS
             All of them, willing at a moment's
             notice to lay down their own lives
             out of devotion to you.

                            ARTIE
             Really?

                            PUSS
             Si, and the whole kingdom will look
             to you for wisdom and guidance.

            Behind Artie, Shrek mouths "shut-up" to Puss and Donkey.

                            DONKEY
             Just make sure they don't die of
             famine.

                            PUSS
             Or plague.

                            DONKEY
             Oh, plague is bad.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 57.



                            PUSS
             The coughing, the groaning, the
             festering sores.

            Shrek interrupts with a mock laugh.

                            SHREK
             Oh! Festering sores! Hey, you are
             one funny kitty cat.

                            PUSS
             What did I say?

                            SHREK
             We don't want Artie here getting
             the wrong idea.

            Shrek motions to Artie, but he's gone. They all look around.

                            SHREK (CONT'D)
             Uh, Artie?

            The boat suddenly pitches to the right. Shrek braces
            himself. Puss and Donkey tumble away.

                            ALL
             Whoa!

            Artie swings the wheel around, sending the boat back in the
            direction of his school. Shrek works his way into the cabin
            and gains control of the wheel. The drunken Ship Captain
            slides by.

                            SHIP CAPTAIN
             Whoa! Oh, there goes my hip.

                            SHREK
             Artie!

            Shrek turns the wheel the other way.

                            SHREK (CONT'D)
             What are you doing?!

            The boat veers again, heading back toward Far Far Away.
            Artie falls to the ground and slides to the back of the boat.

            A shuffle board stick slides next to Artie. He grabs it.

                            ARTIE
             What does it look like?!

            He jams it in the boat's wheel. The boat lurches.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 58.



            He swings the boat back in the other direction. Shrek rises
            up and grabs the wheel and turns it.

                            SHREK
             This really isn't up to you!

            Artie falls underneath the wheel. He stands up shoving the
            wheel back the other way.

                            ARTIE
             But I don't know anything about
             being King!

                            SHREK
             You'll learn on the job!

            Donkey and Puss roll across the deck.

                            DONKEY
             Whoaaa!

            Shrek grabs the wheel and swings it around. Artie yanks the
            wheel. They wrestle for control.

                            ARTIE
             Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm
             going back!

                            SHREK
             Back to what? Being a loser?!

            As soon as the word leaves his lips, Shrek knows he's gone
            too far. Stung, Artie lets go of the wheel, leaving Shrek to
            yank hard on it. He pulls the steering column from the
            decking.

                            SHREK (CONT'D)
             Now look what you did!

                            ARTIE
             Look what I did? Who's holding the
             wheel chief?

            Donkey climbs up onto the railing. He is seasick and is
            about to puke when he sees jagged rocks ahead.

                            DONKEY

                            SHOUTING)
             Shrek!

            Shrek desperately sets the wheel back down and tries to steer
            the ship clear of the rocks.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 59.



            The camera pans past the boat. Off-screen we hear the boat
            crash into the rocks.

             SHIP CAPTAIN (O.S.)
             Land ho!


            EXT. BEACH - DUSK

            Shrek, holding Puss and Donkey, staggers onto a small beach.
            He glares at Artie who pulls himself out of the surf. Shrek
            drops Puss and Donkey.

            Puss, tired of being wet, shakes himself vigorously. His fur
            puffs up into a fro. He drops his head in shame.

                            PUSS
             How humiliating...

                            SHREK
             Oh, nice going, Your Highness.

                            ARTIE
             Oh, so now it's "Your highness?"
             What happened to "loser?" Huh?

                            SHREK
             Hey, if you think this is getting
             you out of anything, well it isn't.
             We're heading back to Far Far Away
             one way or another, and you're
             gonna be a father!

            Artie raises an eyebrow. Puss and Donkey stare at Shrek
            uncomfortably.

                            ARTIE
             What?

                            DONKEY
             (clearing his throat)
             A-hem. You just said father...

                            SHREK
             You're... I said king. You're
             gonna be King!

                            ARTIE
                            (IMITATING SHREK)
             "You're gonna be King!" Yeah
             right.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 60.



            Artie shakes his head and marches down the beach toward a
            path into the woods.

                            SHREK
             Where do you think you're going?

                            ARTIE
             Far Far Away... from you!

                            SHREK
             You get back here young man and I
             mean it!

            Artie keeps climbing.

                            PUSS
             Uh boss, I don't think he's coming
             back and maybe it's for the best.
             He is not exactly king material.

            Shrek looks towards Artie.

                            DONKEY
             When were you planning on telling
             him that you were really supposed
             to be King?

                            SHREK
             Oh c'mon, now why would I do that?
             Besides, he'll be ten times better
             at it than me.

            Shrek starts off after Artie. Donkey jumps in front of Shrek.

                            DONKEY
             Hey, woah ho ho, Shrek. Then
             you're gonna have to change your
             tactics if you want to get anywhere
             with this kid.

            Beat.

                            SHREK
             You're right, Donkey.

            Shrek picks up a piece of driftwood.

                            SHREK
             What about this?

            Donkey shakes his head in disgust.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 61.



                            DONKEY
             Shrek!

            Shrek tosses the log.

                            SHREK
             Oh c'mon. It's just a joke.
                            (LAUGHS)
             Still...

            Shrek walks off, trying to catch up to Artie.


            EXT. FOREST - MOMENTS LATER

            Artie marches up the mountain trail.

            Shrek thinks for a moment and then tries a different tactic
            with the kid. He catches up to Artie.

                            SHREK
             Listen Artie...

            Artie looks back over his shoulder. He sees Shrek and just
            keeps going.

                            SHREK (CONT'D)
             If you think this whole mad scene
             ain't dope, I feel you dude. I
             mean, I'm not trying to get up in
             your grill or raise your roof or
             whatever, but what I am screaming
             is, yo, check out this kazing
             thazing bazaby.

            Puss and Donkey glance at each other. Artie notices a
            cottage in the distance and heads toward it.

                            SHREK
             I mean, if it doesn't groove or
             what I'm saying ain't straight
             trippin', just say, oh no you
             didn't, you know, you're gettin' on
             my last nerve. And then I'll know
             it's... then I'll know it's whack--

            Passing a tree, Artie nonchalantly releases the branch,
            striking Shrek square in the face and takes off running.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 62.




            EXT. MERLIN'S CAMP -- CONTINUOUS

            A boiling soup pot sits over a fire in front of a small
            shack. Artie charges though, pounding desperately on the
            door.

                            ARTIE
             SOMEBODY HELP! I'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED
             BY A MONSTER TRYING TO RELATE TO
             ME!

                            SHREK
             Artie! Wait!


            Shrek, Puss, and Donkey run into the camp.

                            ARTIE
             C'mon! C'mon! Help! Help!
             Hello?

            Suddenly, a burst of light shoots through a candle box that
            is hung on the door. A bright, colorful image of an old
            wizard's head is projected out. Donkey is terrified.

                            DONKEY
             AHHHH!

             WIZARD HEAD (MERLIN)
             Greetings cosmic children of the
             universe, and welcome to my
             serenity circle!

            Shrek watches.

             WIZARD HEAD (MERLIN)
             Please leave any bad vibes outside
             the healing vortex. And now
             prepare ...

            With a "FZZZZT" and a "BLOOP", the image disappears.

            The door opens and a tiny old man, Merlin, comes out.

                            MERLIN
             I knew I should of gotten that
             warranty!

            Merlin smashes the security device with his little fist and
            is promptly zapped in the head.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 63.



                            MERLIN
             AHH! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

                            ARTIE
             Mr. Merlin?

                            SHREK
             You know this guy?

                            ARTIE
             Yeah. He was the school's magic
             teacher until he had his nervous
             breakdown.

                            MERLIN
             Uh, technically I was merely a
             victim of a level three fatigue,
             and at the request of my therapist
             and the school authorities, I have
             retired to the tranquility of
             nature to discover my divine
             purpose.

            Merlin smacks a fly that has landed on his head.

            Shrek and Artie stare in astonishment.



                            MERLIN
             Now, can I interest anyone in a
             snack or beverage?

                            SHREK
             Uh, no.

            Merlin offers up a baking dish full of rocks.

                            MERLIN
             Sure you don't wanna try my famous
             rock au-gratin?

            Merlin takes a bite and chews loudly. His gums are bleeding
            from eating rocks.

                            MERLIN
             It's organic!

            They both stare at him uncomfortably.
            Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 64.



                            SHREK
             Oh, thanks, I just ate a boulder on
             the way in. What we need are
             directions back to Far Far Away.

                            ARTIE
             What's with the "we"? Who said I
             was going with you?

                            SHREK
             Oh, I did. Cause there's a lot of
             people counting on you so don't try
             and weasel out of it.

                            ARTIE
             If it's such a great job, why don't
             you do it?

                            SHREK
             Understand this kid, it's no more
             Mr. Nice Guy from here on out!

                            ARTIE
             Oh, so that was your "Mr. Nice
             Guy?"

                            SHREK
             I know, and I'm gonna miss him.

                            ARTIE
             You know what? Why don't you go
             terrorize a village and leave me
             alone?

                            SHREK
             Oh, is that some kind of crack
             about ogres? You get your royal
             highness to Far Far Away before I
             kick it there.
                            (TO MERLIN)
             Now which way am I kicking?

                            MERLIN
             Oh, I could tell you. But since
             you're in the midst of self-
             destructive rage spiral it would be
             karmic-ly irresponsible.

                            SHREK
             Self-destructive ra...
                            (TO MERLIN)
             Look, are you gonna help us or not?
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 65.



                            MERLIN
             Most definitely, but only after you
             take the journey to your soul.

                            SHREK
             Yeah, I don't think so.

                            MERLIN
             Look pal, it's either that or some
             primal scream therapy.
             Ahhhhhhhhhh!

            Shrek grabs Merlin's mouth and closes it.

                            SHREK
             Alright, alright... journey to the
             soul...

                            CUT TO:


            EXT. MERLIN'S CAMP - LATER

            A fire blazes.

            Merlin throws a handful of dirt into the fire, it flares.

                            MERLIN
             Now all of you, look into the "Fire
             of Truth" and tell me what you see!
             Yah! Ha!
             (Wild war cry)
             Woo-looo-looo-looo!

            He points at the smoke and it starts to form objects (i.e.
            Rorschach inkblots).

            Puss and Donkey, excited, sit by the fire.

                            DONKEY
             Ooo! Charades! Okay, I see a
             dutch fudge torte with cinnamon
             swirls.

                            MERLIN
             Okay. Monster, go for it.

            Shrek glances at the fire. The stroller from his nightmare
            begins to take shape in the smoke. He blows the image away.
            He covers his fear and changes the subject.

                            SHREK
             I see a rainbow pony.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 66.



                            MERLIN
             Excellent work!
                            (THEN)
             Now! The boy!

                            ARTIE
             This is lame.

            Merlin whacks Artie on the back of the head.

                            ARTIE
             Ow!

                            MERLIN
             You're lame! Now just go for it.

            He tosses more dirt and flames burst up. Artie studies it.

                            ARTIE
             Okay. There's a baby bird and a
             father bird sitting in a nest.

            Merlin starts beating a drum. Artie's expression starts to
            change as he stays focused.

                            MERLIN
             Yes! Stay with it! Stay with it!

                            ARTIE
             Wait, the dad just flew away. Why
             did he leave the little bird all
             alone?

            Shrek starts to take this in as he watches. Artie gets more
            worked up.

                            ARTIE
             It's trying to fly, but it doesn't
             know how to. It.. it's gonna fall!

            Suddenly, Artie catches what he said. As the smoke drifts
            away, he looks and sees everyone else staring back at him,
            stunned.

                            MERLIN
             Whew, proper head case you are,
             aren't you? Really messed up.
             Whoa.

            Merlin goes back inside. They all stare at Artie.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 67.



                            ARTIE
             Yeah, yeah, okay. I get it. The
             bird's me. My dad left. So what?


            Donkey gives Shrek a nudge to go over and talk to Artie.
            Shrek hesitates and Donkey insists.

                            SHREK
                            (CLEARS THROAT)
             Look Artie...um-

            Just as he's about to get going, "That's What Friends Are
            For" starts playing loudly from Merlin's security device
            drowning out any conversation. They all turn toward the
            shack where Merlin peeks out.

                            MERLIN
             (loud, over the music)
             Just thought I might help set the
             mood! Y'know for your big heart to
             heart chat!

            Everyone stares at him.

            He sheepishly turns off the device and shuts the door. It's
            quiet again.

                            SHREK
             I know what it's like to not feel
             ready for something.

            Artie looks at him.

                            SHREK
             Even ogres get scared...you know,
             once in a while.

                            ARTIE
             I know you want me to be king, but
             I can't. I'm not cut out for it and
             I never will be, alright?

            Shrek takes this in.

                            ARTIE (CONT'D)
             Even my own dad knew I wasn't worth
             the trouble. He dumped me at that
             school the first chance he got and
             I never heard from him again.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 68.



                            SHREK
             My dad wasn't really the fatherly
             type either.

                            ARTIE
             Well, I doubt he was worse than
             mine.

                            SHREK
             Oh yeah? My father was an ogre.
             He tried to eat me.

            Artie looks at Shrek.

                            SHREK
             Now, I guess I should have seen it
             coming. He used to give me a bath
             in barbecue sauce and put me to bed
             with an apple in my mouth.

            Artie chuckles at this.

                            ARTIE
             Okay... I guess that's... pretty
             bad.

            Artie laughs and then pokes at the fire.

                            SHREK
             You know, it may be hard to believe
             what with my obvious charm and good
             looks, but people used to think
             that I was a monster. And for a
             long time, I believed them.

            Artie looks up at Shrek.

                            SHREK (CONT'D)
             But after awhile, you learn to
             ignore the names that people call
             you and you just trust who you are.

            Artie gently pokes at the embers with a stick for a moment.

                            ARTIE
             You know, you're okay, Shrek.

            He tosses the stick into the fire.

                            ARTIE
             You just need to do a little less
             yelling and use a little more soap.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 69.



                            SHREK
             Thanks Artie.

                            ARTIE
             The soap's because you stink.
             Really bad.

                            SHREK
             Yeah. I got that.

            The camera slowly booms up and away from the group as the
            fire continues to burn.

                            CUT TO:


            INT. SEWER CATACOMBS - CONTINUOUS

            The Princesses, Fiona and the Queen are surrounded by
            darkness as they tiptoe down the steps and into the catacombs
            below the castle.

            They round a corner and step onto a ledge with Fiona leading
            the way, holding a torch.

                            CINDERELLA
             Oh this place is filthy. I feel
             like a hobo.

            Fiona tries to keep her frustration in check.

                            SNOW WHITE
             I'm sorry but this just isn't
             working for me.

            Sleeping Beauty, still being carried by Doris, wakes up.

                            SLEEPING BEAUTY
             Everything's always about you,
             isn't it? It's not like your
             attitude is helping, Snow.

                            SNOW WHITE
             Well maybe it just bothers you that
             I was voted fairest in the land.

                            RAPUNZEL
             You mean in that rigged election?

                            SNOW WHITE
             Oh, give me a break.

             "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down thy
             golden extensions!"

                            QUEEN
             Ladies, let go of your petty
             complaints and let's work together.

            Snow White and Rapunzel share an indignant look.

            Fiona travels deeper into the catacombs. The other
            Princesses follow.

                            SNOW WHITE
             So I guess the plan is we just
             wander aimlessly in this stink hole
             until we rot.

                            FIONA
             No, we're gonna get inside and find
             out what Charming's up to.

                            DORIS
             I know he's a jerk and everything,
             but I gotta admit, that Charming
             makes me hotter than July.

                            SLEEPING BEAUTY
             Ew!

                            RAPUNZEL
             Ugh.

            Finally, Fiona spots what she was looking for.

                            FIONA
             That's it!

            Fiona, the Queen and the Princesses run towards a long ladder
            and climb up through a grate into the main castle courtyard.


            EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

            They peer around a corner and see the construction of an
            outdoor theater is underway. Two stagehands walk by carrying
            a large dragon set piece. Evil dwarves are busy painting the

            The Princesses hug the wall as a group of guards march by.

            Rapunzel takes off in the other direction, and signals the
            Princesses to follow her.

                            RAPUNZEL
             Come on, this way!

                            FIONA
             Rapunzel. Wait!

            Fiona and the Princesses race after Rapunzel. They spot her
            sprinting into the castle and follow her. They burst through
            the doors and see Prince Charming holding Rapunzel by the
            arm.

                            FIONA
             Charming, let go of her.

            A large group of armed Far Far Away Guards surround them.

            Prince Charming smiles at Fiona.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             But why would I want to do that?

                            RAPUNZEL
             Grrrr!

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Woof!

            He looks back at Rapunzel lovingly, and the two share a long
            kiss. Fiona and the other Princesses are shocked.

                            FIONA
             What?

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Say hello ladies, to the new Queen
             of Far Far Away.

            Cinderella claps excitedly.

                            CINDERELLA
             Yaaaaaaaaay!

            The Princesses stare her down.

                            FIONA
             Rapunzel, how could you?

                            RAPUNZEL
             Jealous much?

            Prince Charming eyes up the Princesses.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Soon you'll be back where you
             started... scrubbing floors or
             locked away in towers; that is, if
             I let you last the week.

                            RAPUNZEL
             But Pooky, you promised you
             wouldn't hurt them!

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Not here, "kitten whiskers." Daddy
             will discuss it later. Now forgive
             us, we have a show to put on.

                            FIONA
             Shrek will be back soon Charming,
             and you'll be sorry.

            He stops and flashes a sadistic smile.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Sorry? Don't you realize --once
             Shrek sets foot in Far Far Away
             he's doomed?

            Prince Charming leads Rapunzel out. She looks back at them
            apologetically. Everyone wears a look of defeat.

            The guards march them off.

            Fiona and the princesses are locked away in a prison cell.
            Fiona looks through the bars of the cell, feeling helpless.

            EXT. WOODS OUTSIDE OF FAR FAR AWAY - DAY

            Shrek startles awake. He sits up and scratches his head,
            looking around. He realizes it's morning.

            Behind him a peaceful bird lands on a tree branch. Suddenly,
            the tree branch that was holding the bird flicks it off.

            Shrek senses the movement behind him and turns around to find
            everything is normal. He turns back around to wake up
            everyone.

            The trees start to advance toward Shrek.

            The log Artie is sleeping on suddenly sits up, knocking
            Artie, who is still asleep, to the ground.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 73.



                            ARTIE
             Ow!

            The tree turns around to reveal an Evil Tree. Donkey finally
            wakes up.

                            DONKEY
             Ahhh!

            The Evil Trees continue to advance. A piano is heard. The
            trees part and Hook is revealed to be playing the piano.

            The music builds to a dramatic finale. Captain Hook turns
            away from his keys and faces them.

                            DONKEY
             Look out! They've got a piano!

                            CAPTAIN HOOK
             Kill `em all. Except the fat one.

            He stares hard at Shrek and aims his hooked prosthetic.

                            CAPTAIN HOOK
             King Charming has something special
             in mind for you, ogre.

            Shrek is perplexed.

                            SHREK
             "King Charming?"

                            CAPTAIN HOOK
             Attack!

            Pirates charge forward, swinging in from the tree branches.

                            PIRATES
             AAAARGH!

            One lands and gets his peg-leg stuck in the ground.

            The pirates close in. Shrek grabs one and throws him to the
            side.

            One pirate raises his sword and prepares to swing at Artie.

                            SHREK
             Artie, Duck!

            Shrek pushes Artie's head down and the sword narrowly misses
            him. The pirate prepares to swing again and Shrek lifts
            Artie above his head.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 74.


            Still in the air, Artie uses both legs to kick the pirate to
            the ground. Shrek and Artie share a satisfied look.

            A pirate charges Donkey.

                            DONKEY
             Ahhh!

            Puss draws his sword and begins fighting off the pirate,
            protecting Donkey.

                            CAPTAIN HOOK
             Ha-ha! Argh!

                            PIRATES
             Argh! Argh!

            The camera pans across the back of the piano to reveal Merlin
            happily playing along with Captain Hook. He notices and
            rudely elbows Merlin out of the way.

            A pirate runs at Shrek, only to be tripped by Artie. The
            pirate bounces off Shrek's belly.

                            CAPTAIN HOOK
             Ready the plank!

            A wooden board is thrown on a stump, creating a makeshift
            "plank." The pirates back Shrek onto the plank.

            Several pirates with swords force Shrek onto the plank. He
            is backed up to the edge of the plank and falls into a
            waiting treasure chest below. Several pirates try to shut the
            lid on him.

            Puss, Donkey and Artie are trying to hold off the Villains.
            Suddenly, two Evil Trees come into frame and scoop Puss,
            Donkey and Artie up in a net.

            The pirates aim the cannon at Puss, Donkey and Artie. Artie
            starts to panic. Puss extracts his claws and tries to cut
            through the netting.

            The cannon fuse is lit.

            Shrek bursts open the treasure chest and stands up with the
            chest still stuck to his behind.

                            DONKEY
             Shrek!

                            ARTIE
             Help!
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 75.



            Shrek sees the lit fuse and quickly formulates a plan. He
            grabs two pirates and shoves them into the treasure chest.
            He tosses the chest onto the other end of the plank and
            catapults himself over to the cannon. At the last second,
            Shrek is able to aim the cannon in the opposite direction.
            The cannon fires and hits Captain Hook's piano, blowing it
            into pieces.

            Realizing their defeat, the Evil Trees drop the netting that
            holds Donkey, Puss and Artie. The Evil Trees and Pirates
            take off running.

            Captain Hook turns and sees his army running off. He shakes
            his hook in the air.

                            CAPTAIN HOOK
             Ya cowards!

                            SHREK
             What has Charming done with Fiona?

                            CAPTAIN HOOK
             She's gonna get what's coming to
             her.

            He raises his hook threateningly but it gets caught on an
            Evil Tree's branch and is dragged away with the rest of the
            Villains.

                            CAPTAIN HOOK
             Ahhh.
                            (YELLING BACK)
             And there ain't nothing you can do
             to stop him!

            TIGHT ON SHREK, filled with worry. Nothing else matters to
            him now.

            Artie, Puss, and Donkey run over to Shrek.

                            PUSS
             We've got to save her!

                            DONKEY
             But she's so far far away!

            Shrek thinks for a moment.

                            SHREK
             Get yourself back to
             Worcestershire, kid.

                            ARTIE
             No, Shrek. Hold on a second. I've
             got an idea.


            EXT. MERLIN'S CAMP - CONTINUOUS

            Merlin is sitting cross-legged, deep in meditation. Artie
            approaches him.

                            MERLIN
                            (CHANTING)
             I'm a buzzing bee, buzz, buzz,
             buzz...

                            ARTIE
             Mr. Merlin, they need a spell to
             get them...I mean, us, back to Far
             Far Away.

            Merlin stops meditating and looks out of the corner of his
            eye at Artie.

                            MERLIN
                            (GETTING UP)
             Forget it. I don't have that kind
             of magic in me anymore, kid. How
             about a hug instead? Hmm? That's
             the best kind of magic.

            Artie tries a new approach.

                            ARTIE
             Mr. Merlin please. I know you can
                            DO IT-

                            MERLIN
             I said, forget it!

                            ARTIE
                            BUT-

            Merlin turns and starts to walk away muttering under his
            breath.

                            MERLIN (CONT'D)
             Mumble, grumble, interrupt my
             healing. Mumble, mumble.

            Artie thinks for a moment, staring at Merlin. Artie starts
            to sob. Merlin stops and turns around.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 77.



                            MERLIN
             Oh. What, what's with you?

            Artie continues to cry.

                            ARTIE
             It's just so hard. You know? They
             really need to get back `cause
             their kingdom's in trouble `cause
             there's a really bad man and it's
             just so hard...

            Merlin is visibly uncomfortable.

                            MERLIN
             C'mon, take it easy.

            Artie's blubbering becomes frustrated and unpredictable.

                            ARTIE
             No! I don't think you understand!
             There's a mean person doing mean
             things to good people-

                            SHREK
             Oh, have a heart old man!

            Artie grabs him, now desperate.

                            ARTIE
             And they really need your help to
             get them back! So why won't you
             help them?

                            MERLIN
             Oh.

            Artie speaks one last, indecipherable line.

            Merlin is stunned. He doesn't know what to do.

                            MERLIN
             Uh, Okay... I'll go and get my
             things.

            Merlin goes into his cave. Artie immediately recovers.
            Shrek is impressed.

                            ARTIE
             Piece of cake.

                            SHREK
             Well, well, well. You want some
             eggs with that ham?

            Shrek smiles.

            Merlin returns holding a spell book.

                            MERLIN
             Now, I am a little rusty, so there
             could be some side effects.

                            DONKEY
             Side effects!?

                            MERLIN
             Don't worry, whatever it is, no
             matter how excruciatingly painful
             it may be, it'll wear off
             eventually... I think.

            Merlin cracks his knuckles. A bolt of lighting shoots out
            his hands and blows up a rock next to Donkey.

                            DONKEY
             Ah!

                            MERLIN
             Oops.

            Donkey and Puss shoot Shrek a pleading look.

                            DONKEY
             Are you sure this is a good idea?

                            SHREK
             Look, if Artie trusts him, that's
             good enough for me. Even if his
             robe doesn't quite cover his-

                            MERLIN
             Alacraticious expeditious, a zoomy
             zoom zoom. Let's help our friends
             get back, um... soon!

            Magic rays shoot out of Merlin's fingers. Shrek, Puss,
            Donkey and Artie disappear in a puff of smoke.

                            MERLIN
             Woah! It worked!

            They reappear and fall out of the sky and bounce through the
            canopy of a large apple tree. They ping-pong through the
            foliage and land in a heap at the base of the tree.

             teeth?

            Donkey's eyes widen. He realizes his voice is coming out of
            Puss' body.

                            DONKEY
             (in Puss' body)
             Huh? What the?
                            (GASP)
             Oh no!

            Donkey (in Puss' body) grabs Puss' hat. He looks down at
            Puss' boots. His tail begins to twitch.

                            DONKEY
             (in Puss' body)
             I've been abracadabra'd into a
             fancy feasting second rate
             sidekick.

            Puss (in Donkey's body) falls from a tree next to Donkey (in
            Puss' body).

                            PUSS
             (in Donkey's body)
             At least you don't look like some
             kind of bloated roadside piñata.
             You really should think about going
             on a diet!
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 80.



                            DONKEY
             (in Puss' body)
             Yeah, and you should think about
             getting yourself a pair of pants!
             I feel all exposed and nasty.

            Both Shrek and Artie stare at them. A strained smile pasted
            to their faces. They burst out laughing.

            Donkey joins Puss, both of them scowling.

                            DONKEY
             (in Puss' body)
             Oh, so you two think this is funny?

            Puss is fuming.

            Shrek and Artie regain their composure.

                            ARTIE
                            (SNICKERS)
             I'm really sorry guys.

                            SHREK
             Don't be! You got us back kid.

            Shrek motions to Far Far Away, just a few miles ahead of
            them. He turns back to Artie.

            Artie smiles.

            Donkey takes a few awkward steps in Puss' body.

                            DONKEY
             (in Puss' body)
             Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. How in the
             Hans Christian Andersen am I
             supposed to parade around in these
             goofy boots?

                            PUSS
             Be very careful with those - HEE
             HAW!

            Puss is shocked by this. He tries to recover.

                            PUSS
             They were made in Madrid by the
             finest- HEE HAW!
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 81.



                            DONKEY
             (in Puss' body)
             Oh, you'll learn to control that.

             TIME CUT TO:


            EXT. ENTRANCE TO FAR FAR AWAY - AFTERNOON

            Shrek, Puss (in Donkey's body), and Artie rush past a welcome
            sign to the town that has been boarded over so it now reads
            "Go Go Away."

            Donkey (in Puss' body) struggles to walk. His tender new
            feet hurt in their tiny boots.

                            DONKEY
             Seriously man, you need some
             comfort inserts or arch supports or
             something.
             (noticing Rodeo Drive)
             Woah!

            Inside the kingdom, Rodeo Drive is trashed. There is graffiti
            everywhere.

            Suddenly a carriage driven by Evil Witches comes zooming down
            Rodeo Drive.

                            EVIL WITCHES
             Woohoo!!

            The carriage zips around a corner on two wheels. A drunken
            Evil Dwarf is almost hit by the carriage while crossing the
            street.

            Shrek is shocked by what he sees.

            A crash is heard off-screen.

                            EVIL DWARF #1
             Hey... watch it I'm walking here...
             and I'm gonna keep going...

            A large explosion is heard off-screen while Little Red Riding
            Hood pick pockets the Evil Dwarf.

            A carriage wheel on fire rolls by a marionette theatre with
            Pinocchio dancing in it.

                            SHREK
             Pinocchio?
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 82.



                            PINOCCHIO
             Shrek!

            Shrek and the rest rush over as the curtain starts to go down
            on Pinocchio. He presses his puppet hands against the glass.

                            SHREK
             Pinocchio!

                            PINOCCHIO
             Help me!

                            SHREK
             What's happened?

                            PINOCCHIO
             Charming and the Villains have
             taken over everything! They
             attacked us but Fiona and the
             Princesses got away. And now she's-
                            -

            The time has run out. The cheesy music stops as the curtain
            goes down.

                            SHREK
             She's what?! She's what!?

            Shrek looks at the marionette theatre and sees how much it
            costs per show.

                            SHREK
             (turns to Puss in Donkey's
                            BODY)
             Puss, loan me five bucks!

                            DONKEY
             C'mon Puss, you heard the man, help
             a brother out.

                            PUSS
             (in Donkey's body)
             Do you see any pockets on me?

                            DONKEY
             (in Puss' body)
             Hold on a second.

            Donkey (in Puss' body) removes his boot, he turns it over and
            a bag of money falls onto the ground.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 83.



                            DONKEY
             (in Puss' body)
             Aha!

            Donkey (in Puss' body) tosses the money to Shrek.

                            PUSS
             (in Donkey's body)
             I had no idea ...really ...I swear.

            Shrek quickly dumps the change into the machine. The music
            starts and the curtain goes up again and Pinocchio dances.

                            SHREK
             Quick, Pinocchio. Where is Fiona?

                            PINOCCHIO
             Charming's got her locked away some
             place secret. You gotta find him!
             He's probably getting ready for the
                            SHOWWWW---

            The curtain goes down again.

                            SHREK
             Wait, wait, wait! Pinocchio! What
             show?

            Pinocchio's hand comes out from under the curtain and points
            to a poster on the wall. Puss reads the poster out loud.

                            PUSS
             (reading the poster)
             It's A Happily Ever After, After
             All!

                            SHREK
             Shrek's final performance.

            The picture shows Charming, sword raised in the air, with his
            foot pinning Shrek, tongue sticking out of his mouth, to the
            ground.

                            DONKEY
             (in Puss' body)
             Whoa, Shrek! You didn't tell us
             you were in a play.

                            SHREK
             Well I guess I've been so busy I
             forgot to mention it!
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 84.



             GUARD #1 (O.S.)
             It's the ogre! Get him!

            Shrek turns and sees a large group of Charming's royal
            knights, armed and ready. They drive them back into the
            alley. Puss (in Donkey's body) steps forward.

                            PUSS
             (in Donkey's body)
             Don't worry, Jefe. I got this.

            He whips his head towards the oncoming guards. His eyes are
            large and sweet. His lips pout. The guards are momentarily
            hypnotized by his cuteness, until they realize they're
            staring at a donkey.

            The guards recoil.

                            GUARD #2
             Ugh! Kill it!

            Puss (in Donkey's body) immediately retreats.

            Artie glances at the theater poster on the wall and steps
            forward, confronting the guards.

                            ARTIE
             Look, don't you know who he thinks
             he is? How dare you?

            Shrek picks up on his plan.

                            SHREK
             Donkey, we're dealing with
             amateurs.

            The guards are confused. Artie tears the poster off the
            wall. Shrek glances at Artie, who steps forward, yanking the
            poster off the wall.

                            ARTIE
             He's a star people! Hello?! I'm so
             sorry about this Mr. Shrek.

                            SHREK
             I'm gonna lose it!

                            ARTIE
             I assume you have everything ready
             for tonight! You did get the list
             for the dressing room?

            Donkey marches in.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 85.



                            DONKEY
             (in Puss' body)
             Yeah, the breakfast croissants
             stuffed with seared sashimi tuna.
             Oh, and please tell me you at least
             have the saffron corn with the
             jalapeno honey butter cause our
             client cannot get into his proper
             emotional state without his
             jalapeno honey butter.

                            SHREK
             I just lost it!

                            GUARD #1
             Uh...Maybe they should talk to
             Nancy in Human Resources.

            Shrek pushes the guards aside and continues on towards the
            castle.

                            PUSS
             (in Donkey's body)
             Oh, we'll have much to say to
             Nancy, I promise!

            The guards look at each other nervously.

                            CUT TO:


            INT. COURTYARD STAGE - DAY

            A group of enchanted trees work on through their dance
            number.

            Two dwarfs on bungee chords helplessly swing back and forth
            in the rear of the stage.

            The camera lands on Prince Charming reading his lines next to
            a Shrek stand in.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             (reading his lines from a
                            SCRIPT)
             With this sword, I do- No.

            He starts the line over.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             With this sword, I do smote thee!
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 86.



            Without looking, Prince Charming stabs the stand in, who
            falls to the ground.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
                            (TO HIMSELF) )
             Is that the right word? "Smote?"
             "Smooote." Is that even a word
             actually? Maybe I should just
             smite him.

            Unseen stage hands drag the stand-in away.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Let's try this again. Now...


            Stagehands shove another stand in onto the stage beside
            Prince Charming.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             (playing the scene out
                            QUIETLY)
             Shrek attacks me, I pretend to be
             afraid.
             (he fake screams)
             Ooh!!!

            Prince Charming does a quick mime of being afraid and
            chuckles.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             I say...
             (he riffles through pages)
             "Finally the Kingdom will get the
             happily ever after they deserve,
             die Ogre", blah, blah, blah...

            Without looking he stabs stand in #2. He falls to the ground.
            Prince Charming is still frustrated.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Oh! It just doesn't feel real
             enough yet!

            He throws the sword to the ground and turns toward the
            dancing villains who are staring at him.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Who told you to stop dancing?!

                            CYCLOPS
             Uh... Wink and turn, wink and turn.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 87.



            He throws the script on the ground and notices the stand-in.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             And what are you laying around for?
             Get up! Honestly.

            Prince Charming storms off.

                            CUT TO:


            INT. CHARMING'S DRESSING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

            Prince Charming storms into his colossal gold leafed dressing
            room, its walls covered with posters of inspirational sayings
            and portraits of Prince Charming in different acting roles.

            Slamming the door, he plops down in his throne chair in front
            of a dressing table and large 3-way mirror. A statuette of
            his mother is on the vanity. He looks at it intently.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Our happily ever after is nearly
             complete, mummy. And I assure you,
             the people of this kingdom will pay
             dearly for every second we've had
             to wait.



            Charming adjusts the mirror, revealing a reflection of Shrek
            standing in the doorway. Artie, Puss and Donkey stand along
            side him.

            Prince Charming quickly stands up and faces Shrek.

                            SHREK
             Break a leg. Or, on second
             thought, let me break it for you.

            He walks across the room as Prince Charming backs against his
            dressing table.

            Prince Charming fumbles behind his back and pushes a button
            under the counter.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Thank goodness you're here. I was
             beginning to think you might not
             make it back in... time.

            Shrek picks him up by the front of his shirt and scowls.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 88.



                            SHREK
             Where's Fiona?

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Don't worry. She and the others
             are safe. For now.

            Shrek strengthens his grip.

            Suddenly, a group of guards burst into the room and quickly
            surround Shrek, Artie, Puss and Donkey.

                            ARTIE
             Ow.

            Prince Charming smiles.

            Shrek looks around and realizes he's beat. He drops Charming
            with a thud.

            Prince Charming brushes himself off as the guards surround
            Shrek.

            Prince Charming walks over to Artie. A smile grows across
            his face.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Let me guess... Arthur?

            Artie looks indignant. He raises himself up.

                            ARTIE
             It's Artie, actually.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             This boy is supposed to be the new
             King of Far Far Away?

            Laughing, Prince Charming draws his sword and holds it up to
            Artie's neck.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             How pathetic! Now, stand still so I
             won't make a mess.

            Shrek steps in.

                            SHREK
             Charming, stop! I'm here now, you
             got what you wanted. This isn't
             about him.

            Artie is confused.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 89.



                            ARTIE
             Then who's it about? I'm supposed
             to be King, right?

            Shrek hesitates and then gathers himself.

                            SHREK
             You weren't really next in line for
             the throne, okay? I was.

                            ARTIE
             But you said the King asked for me
             personally.

                            SHREK
             Not exactly.

                            ARTIE
             What's that supposed to mean?


            Shrek becomes defensive.

                            SHREK
             Look, I said whatever I had to say,
             alright! I wasn't right for the
             job, I just needed some fool to
             replace me, and you fit the bill.
             So just go!

            Artie is stunned.

                            ARTIE
             You were playing me the whole time.

            Shrek fights back tears as he punishes Artie more.

                            SHREK
             You catch on real fast kid... Maybe
             you're not as big of a loser as I
             thought.

            Puss (in Donkey's body) is about to interject when Donkey (in
            Puss' body) covers his mouth and signals him to stay quiet.

                            ARTIE
             You know, for a minute there, I
             actually thought you -

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             What? That he cared about you? He's
             an ogre. What did you expect?
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 90.



            Prince Charming signals the guards to release Artie. He
            stares at Shrek one last time and heads out.

            Shrek lowers his head in shame.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             You really do have a way with
             children, Shrek.

            Prince Charming smiles and the guards lead Shrek off.


            INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CHARMING'S DRESSING ROOM:

            Shrek is led by the guards down the hallway.


            EXT. CASTLE GATE:

            The scene cross-dissolves to Artie's back as he walks away
            from the castle. He gives one last look back, and angrily
            storms away.


            INT. DUNGEON:

            Shrek's ankles and wrists are shackled. Shrek pulls on his
            chains. He sadly looks out the cell window.


            INT. PRISON:

            The scene cross-disolves to another prison window. Fiona
            comes to the window of her prison cell. She stares
            sorrowfully at the castle in the distance.


            INT. FAR FAR AWAY PRISON CELL - DAY

            All of the Princesses, the Queen and Fiona are locked up in
            the same prison cell.

            Cinderella is frantically scrubbing a spot on the floor to a
            shine.

            Fiona looks out the cell window towards the castle in the
            distance. Behind her, Snow White paces around, complaining.

                            SNOW WHITE
             Had we just stayed put like I
             suggested, we could be sipping tea
             out of little heart-shaped cups...
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 91.



                            CINDERELLA
             Yeah... yeah, heart shaped cups.

                            SNOW WHITE
             Eating crumpets smothered with
             loganberries.

                            CINDERELLA
             Yeah... loganberries.

                            SNOW WHITE
             Shut up Cindy.

                            CINDERELLA
             Yeah, shut up.

            Cinderella looks down at her reflection in the floor.

                            CINDERELLA (REFLECTION)
             No! You shut up!

                            CINDERELLA
             Just stay out of this!

                            SNOW WHITE
             Who cares who's running the kingdom
             anyway?

                            FIONA
             I care.

            Fiona steps forward and challenges them.

                            QUEEN
             And you should all care too.

            Suddenly, the cell door flies open. Donkey and Puss (in each
            other's bodies) are tossed in as the door is slammed behind
            them.

                            PUSS
             (in Donkey's body)
             Hey, hey, hey, hey.

                            DONKEY
             (in Puss' body)
             Yeah, and I have your badge number,
                            "TIN CAN-"

            Puss, in Donkey's body, hisses and arches his back like a
            cat.

             FIONA (O.S.)

             (in Puss' body)

                            FIONA
             Puss?!

                            PUSS
             (in Donkey's body)
             Lo siento, Princessa, but I am
             Puss, stuck here inside this
             hideous body.

                            DONKEY
             (in Puss' body)
             And I'm me!

                            FIONA
                            BUT YOU'RE-

                            DONKEY
             (in Puss' body)
             I know, I know. Everything's a
             little fruity in the loops right
             now. But what happened is, we went
             to high school, the boat crashed,
             and we got "bippity-bopity-booped"
             by the "Magic Man."

                            DORIS

                            CINDERELLA
             I don't get it.

                            SNOW WHITE
             The cat turned into a little horse
             that smells like feet. What's to
             get?

                            SLEEPING BEAUTY
                            (WAKING UP)
             Huh? Who dat?

                            FIONA
             Where's Shrek?
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 93.



                            DONKEY
             Charming's got him, Princess. And
             he plans on killing Shrek tonight
             in front of the whole kingdom.

            Fiona's lets out a breath.

                            FIONA
             Alright everyone, we need to find a
             way out, now.

            The Princesses nod in agreement.

                            SNOW WHITE
             You're right.
             (to the other Princesses)
             Ladies, assume the position!

            Sleeping Beauty falls asleep standing up. Snow White quickly
            assumes her position by lying down and puckering her lips.
            Cinderella dusts off a spot, sits down and crosses her legs.

                            FIONA
             What are you doing?

                            SLEEPING BEAUTY
             Waiting to be rescued.

                            FIONA
             You have got to be kidding me.

                            SNOW WHITE
             Well, what do you expect us to do?
             We're just four...
                            (NOTICES DORIS)
             I mean, three, super hot
             princesses, two circus freaks, a
             pregnant ogre and an old lady.

            The Queen smiles and then casually walks by the Princesses.

                            QUEEN
             Hmmm. Excuse me. Old lady coming
             through.

            She walks right up to the brick wall, takes a deep breath and
            lets out a yell.

                            QUEEN
             Hiiiyyyiiiaaaah!

            She head-butts a hole right through the brick wall. Fiona
            and the Princesses are impressed.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 94.



             PRINCESSES/PUSS/DONKEY
             Whoa.

                            FIONA
             Mom!?

                            QUEEN
             Well, you didn't actually think you
             got your fighting skills from your
             father, did you?

            Fiona beams at her mother and then turns to the Princesses.

            Snow White points to another wall behind them.

                            SNOW WHITE
             Excuse me, I think there's still
             one more.

            The Queen turns and sees the another wall barring their way.

                            QUEEN
             Hmmmm.

            The Queen hurries to the other wall.

                            QUEEN
             Hiiiiyah!

            It crumbles, revealing the outside. The princesses wince.

            Fiona approaches her mother.

            The Queen turns around, this time a little woozy, singing
            softly to herself.

                            FIONA
             Why don't you just lie down?

            The Queen continues to sing to herself as she walks away.

            Fiona turns to the others.

                            FIONA
             Okay girls, from here on out, we're
             gonna take care of business
             ourselves.

            Snow thinks for a moment and then glances at the other
            Princesses. They nod.

            Snow looks determined. She rips off a sleeve, revealing a
            Dopey tattoo.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 95.



            Sleeping Beauty tears the bottom of her dress.

            The Queen puts lipstick smudges under her eyes (a la a
            football player).

            Cinderella sharpens the heal of her glass slipper.

            Doris burns her bra.

            The Princesses place their hands over Fiona's. Puss and
            Donkey's hands come in last.

            SHREK stands atop a wooden platform, like a beaten man.
            Cyclops is binding his arms and legs with heavy chains
            attached to the floor.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 96.



            He pulls the chains tight.

                            SHREK
             Oww, easy.

                            CYCLOPS
             Sorry. I guess I was just showing
             off for the little one.

                            SHREK
             Huh?

                            CYCLOPS
             It's "Bring your kids to work day."
             C'mere beautiful.

            Cyclops motions to the shadows.

            CYCLOPS' DAUGHTER walks out from the shadows. She looks like
            Cyclops with long hair and skirt.

            Shrek recoils.

                            SHREK
             Well... she's got your eye.

            Cyclops picks her up and embraces her.

                            CYCLOPS
             Who woulda thought a monster like
             me deserves something as special as
             you?

            They touch foreheads affectionately.

            The camera booms down into some trees just outside of the
            castle. Fiona and the Princesses appear behind a log. Two
            Evil Trees guard the castle gate. Fiona uses a duck call to
            signal Snow White. She skips down the path toward a side
            entrance, where two Evil Trees are standing guard. Snow
            White stops in front of them, singing our version of: "Animal
            Friends/With A Smile."

             Oh boy.

            Prince Charming relishes the moment, pulling out his sword
            and aiming it at Shrek's chest. Prince Charming's voice
            climbs even higher.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             You are about to enter
             a world of pain with which you are
                            NOT-
                            (SINGING)
             "FamiliaAAAAAAR!"

            He holds the last, highest note. Shrek winces. Goblets, eye
            glasses, a glass tiara and glass pearls all break in the
            audience.

            Prince Charming smiles. Shrek looks at him with contempt.

                            SHREK
             Well it can't be anymore painful
             than the lousy performance you're
             giving.

            The audience laughs at Shrek's remark. Prince Charming is
            thrown by their reaction.

            From a trap door underneath the stage Rumplestiltskin tries
            to help Prince Charming out by feeding him his next line.

                            RUMPLESTILTSKIN
             "Prepare foul beast."

            He clears his throat and tries to get back into character.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
                            (SINGING)
             "Prepare foul beast, your time is
             done."

                            SHREK
             Oooh, if you don't mind could you
             kill me, and then sing?
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 106.



            The audience laughs. Prince Charming gets in Shrek's face.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Be quiet!

                            SHREK
             Oh, come on, I'm just havin' fun
             with ya. That's actually a very
             nice leotard.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Thank you.

                            SHREK
             Do they come in men's sizes?

            The audience laughs again.

                            HOOK
             He, he. Now that be funny.

            The crowd laughs again. Shrek smiles, enjoying how he's
            screwing up the show. Prince Charming is furious.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             ENOUGH!

            The crowd falls silent.

            Prince Charming turns back to Shrek.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Now you'll finally know what it's
             like to have everything you've
             worked for, everything that's
             precious to you taken away.

            Prince Charming raises his sword.

             PRINCE CHARMING (CONT'D)
             Now you'll know how I felt.

            Suddenly a fireball hits the blade, melting it.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Ahhhhh!

            Another huge fireball spreads across the sky as Dragon flies
            above the theater. The Dronkeys follow behind her.

                            DRAGON
             Roar!
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 107.



            The Three Pigs come running down the aisle.

                            PIG #1
             Sausage Roll!!

            The Three Pigs leap onto the stage, going into a drop and
            roll move to land in between Shrek and Prince Charming. They
            strike a fighting pose.

            Pinocchio comes flying in on his strings, landing with a
            flurry of kung-fu hands.

            The Wolf unzips the wolf costume, steps out and joins the
            others.

            Gingerbread Man pops up in the tower window, grabs Rapunzel's
            hair and swings down. Before he hits the ground, the end
            catches and he bounces like a bungee jumper. Her hair falls
            into a pile next to a very surprised Gingerbread Man.

            Rapunzel screams. Her mousy brown hair crammed under a hair
            net. She runs off crying.

            Prince Charming looks around, almost surrounded.

            Suddenly a shadow falls over the crowd and they gasp. Dragon
            and the Dronkeys fly in and land on the stage.

            Puss and Donkey leap off her back to the stage.

                            DONKEY
             (in Puss's body)

             (in Donkey's body)
             ...Puss!

            He claps his hooves on the stage.

                            DONKEY
             (in Puss' body)
             And Donkey!


            He carves a letter "D" on Pinocchio's bottom.

                            PINOCCHIO
             (re: his bottom)
             Hey.

            The Queen head-butts through one of the backdrops, with
            Sleeping Beauty and Doris. Snow White flies in behind them
            with the help of her woodland creatures ("Crouching Tiger,
            Hidden Dragon" style). Cinderella runs on stage equipped with
            a mop as her weapon. Together, the Princesses strike fierce
            poses and stand next to Shrek.

            The audience applauds.

            Suddenly the front door of the "swamp house" set crashes to
            the floor, revealing Fiona.

                            FIONA
             Hi honey! Sorry we're late. You
             okay?

                            SHREK
             Much better, now that you're here.

                            AUDIENCE
             Awwwwwww!

            The audience applauds. Shrek turns to Prince Charming
            raising his shackled wrists.

                            SHREK
             So Charming, you wanna let me out
             of these so we can settle this ogre
             to man?

            Prince Charming considers this for a second.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Oooh, that sounds fun. But I have
             a better idea!

            Prince Charming strikes an imperious pose and claps his
            hands. Cyclops suddenly emerges from the trap door, knocking
            Puss and Donkey down. He approaches them menacingly.

            The witches fly in and threaten the princesses with their
            brooms. The Evil Queen rises up behind the Queen and puts a
            knife to her throat.

            The Evil Dwarves grab The Three Pigs. Gingerbread Man is
            suddenly surrounded by many Evil Knights. He poops out a gum-
            ball.

            Dragon starts to move forward only to find herself surrounded
            by crossbows. A bunch of pirates grab Fiona and tie her up.

                            SHREK
             Fiona!
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 109.



                            FIONA
             No! Let go of me!

            Shrek struggles to free himself of the chains, but it's no
            use.

            Prince Charming's eyes narrow.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             You will not ruin things this time
             ogre.
                            (TO VILLAINS)
             Kill it!

            Prince Charming signals to the villains to attack Shrek. As
            the villains advance towards Shrek, a spotlight shines in
            their eyes, stopping them in their tracks.

                            ARTIE
             Everybody stop!

                            PRINCE CHARMING
                            (EXASPERATED)
             Oh, what is it now?

                            SHREK
             Artie?

            Artie jumps from the spotlight.

            Artie lands clumsily on a hanging cloud.

            Artie leaps awkwardly from cloud to cloud. The audience
            stares in awe.

            After one last leap, he swings down on the Cherub's cable,
            sending the little person up in the air.

            Artie lands on the stage in between the Villains and Shrek.
            He stands facing the Villains.

                            ARTIE
             Who really thinks we need to settle
             things this way?

            The Evil Knights think about it and raise their hands. The
            other Villains follow suit.

                            ARTIE
             You're telling me you just want to
             be Villains your whole lives?

            This gives the Villains pause.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 110.



                            CAPTAIN HOOK
             But we are Villains. It's the only
             thing we know.

                            ARTIE
             Didn't you ever wish you could be
             something else?

            The Villains aren't convinced.

                            EVIL TREE #2
             Well, it's easy for you to say.
             You're not some evil enchanted
             tree.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             You morons! Don't listen to him!
                            ATTACK THEM-

            Another Evil Tree covers Prince Charming's mouth and then
            motions to Artie.

                            EVIL TREE #1
             What Steve's trying to say here is
             that it's hard to come by honest
             work when the whole world's against
             you.

                            EVIL TREE #2
             Right, thanks Ed.

                            ARTIE
             Okay, fair enough. You're right.
             I'm not a talking tree. But, ya
             know, a good friend of mine once
             told me that just because people
             treat you like a villain, or an
             ogre...

            Artie shares a look with Shrek.

                            ARTIE
             ... or just some loser...

            The Fairy-tale Villains listen intently.

                            ARTIE (CONT'D)
             ...it doesn't mean you are one.

            The Evil Tree tightens his grip as Prince Charming struggles
            to break free.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 111.



                            ARTIE (CONT'D)
             The thing that matters most is what
             you think of yourself.

            Artie commands the stage.

                            ARTIE (CONT'D)
             If there's something you really
             want, or there's someone you really
             want to be, then the only person
             standing in your way ...is you.

            Artie points at Rumplestiltskin directly in front of him.
            Rumplestiltskin is alarmed.

                            RUMPLESTILTSKIN
             Me?

                            OTHER PIRATES
             Get `im lads!

                            ARTIE
             No, no, no! What I mean is: each
             of you is standing in your own way!

                            VILLAINS
             Oooooooh!

            The Headless Horseman breaks through the crowd.

                            HEADLESS HORSEMAN
             I've always wanted to play the
             flute.

            The Fairy-tale Villains and Creatures look at each other.
            The Evil Queen steps up.

                            EVIL QUEEN
             I`d like to open up a spa in
             France.

            The Villains nod in agreement.

                            CAPTAIN HOOK
             I grow daffodils!

            Complete silence as everyone stares at Hook.

                            CAPTAIN HOOK
             And they're beautiful!

            Captain Hook looks thoughtfully at his sword, then throws it
            down.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 112.


            The pirates throw theirs down, followed by the witches and
            Evil Knights. The evil knight holding Pinocchio is thinking
            about it when Pinocchio reaches over and takes the ax from
            him. The weapons pile up in the middle of the stage. Everyone
            else cheers and starts to mingle, introducing themselves and
            shaking hands.

            Gingerbread Man high fives with an Evil Knight. Fiona is
            untied.

            Mabel walks up to Doris and lightly punches her on the jaw.
            Doris returns the sign of affection by punching Mabel in the
            jaw, but a bit too hard, sending her falling to the ground.

            Suddenly, Prince Charming kicks himself free of the Evil Tree
            and charges them. He grabs a sword from the discard pile and
            raises it up, his aim set at Artie.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Aaaahhhh!

            Despite his fear, Artie faces Prince Charming bravely. As
            Prince Charming charges, Shrek finds the strength to break
            his chains. Just before Prince Charming strikes, a chain
            whips into frame, wrapping around the sword. Shrek pulls
            Prince Charming around in a circle, away from Artie. Furious,
            he charges Shrek and stabs him with the sword. Charming lets
            go and Shrek stumbles back with the weapon impaled in him,
            and falls to the floor, groaning.

            Prince Charming beams, and laughs. He turns to the audience.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             A new era finally begins!

            The audience cowers.

            Shrek looks up smiling and nods at Fiona and Artie.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Now, all of you, bow before your
             king!

            Shrek casually rises up behind him and clears his throat.

                            SHREK
             Ah-hem.

            Charming turns around. Shrek lifts his arm revealing that he
            was never really stabbed.

                            SHREK (CONT'D)
             You need to work on your aim.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 113.



            Charming is stunned.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             This was supposed to be my happily
             ever after.

            Prince Charming is paralyzed. Shrek drops the sword and grabs
            him by the shirt-front, lifting him off of his feet.

            He winces, but is still defiant.

                            SHREK
             Well I guess you need to keep
             looking...

            Shrek looks at Fiona and at his friends and smiles.

                            SHREK
             ...cause I'm not giving up mine.

            Shrek sets Prince Charming down and signals DRAGON. She
            casually tips the tower over with her tail. A shadow falls
            over Prince Charming. He turns and sees the tower falling
            toward him, his body perfectly framed up in the princesses's

             Mommy?

            It crashes down and he's trapped inside.

            As the dust clears, the crown rolls across the stage. Artie
            stops it with his foot and slowly picks it up.

                            SHREK
             It's yours if you want it, you
             know, but this time it's your
             choice.

            Artie considers it.

            He looks at Shrek, who is smiling proudly at him.

            Artie turns to the audience and holds out the crown to them.
            They cheer him.

            Artie places the crown on his head. The crowd goes nuts. In
            the audience, Raul sobs with joy.

                            ALL
             Ar-tie! Ar-tie! Ar-tie! Ar-tie!
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 114.



            Everybody cheers as the Fairy-tale Creatures and Villains put
            Artie up on their shoulders and carry him off. Donkey and
            Puss, still in each other's bodies, watch as Artie gets
            carried away.

            In a puff of smoke, Merlin suddenly appears. He looks around
            confused, clutching his show ticket.

                            MERLIN
             Uh, excuse me, that's my seat.

            Suddenly he is thrown back against the front of the stage as
            Donkey and Puss confront him.

                            PUSS
             (in Donkey's body)
             Okay, senor hocus-y pocus-y. The
             time has come to rectify some
             wrongs!

                            DONKEY
             (in Puss' body)
             Although I have been enjoying these
             "cat baths."

                            PUSS
             (in Donkey's body)
             Please say you didn't.

                            MERLIN
             Uh... alright, alright...look..

            Merlin rubs his hands together.

                            MERLIN
             You're gonna feel a little pinch,
             and possibly some lower intestinal
             discomfort, but this should do the
             trick.

            Merlin rolls up his sleeves, and prepares to make with the
            magic. He lets loose with a bright burst of magic. It takes a
            moment for Donkey and Puss to recover. They eye each other
            cautiously.

                            PUSS
             Are you..?

            Donkey lifts his hoof and inspects it carefully.

                            DONKEY
             I'm me again!
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 115.



            Puss checks out his own paws.

                            PUSS
             And I am not you!

            Donkey and Puss give each other a big hug.

                            DONKEY
             Alright!

            The two of them turn and walk away together.

            Merlin is behind them, smoking fingers and all. Suddenly his
            eyes grow wide.

                            MERLIN
             Oops. Ah, never mind.

            We see that Donkey still has Puss' tail and Puss had
            Donkey's. Merlin slips away.

            Shrek and Fiona watch Artie in the distance.

                            SHREK
             What'd I tell ya? I think the
             kid's going to be a great King.

                            FIONA
             Well, for what it's worth, you
             would have too.

            Shrek smiles, and touches Fiona's belly.

                            SHREK
             I have something much more
             important in mind.

            They kiss.

            The camera pulls back to see everyone celebrating around
            Shrek and Fiona as they kiss.

            INT. SWAMP HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

            Shrek grabs a "gourd" bottle and creates an ogre shake out of
            slug juice, eye balls and worms. He walk over to join Fiona
            by the fire.

                            SHREK
             Ah, finally.

            Shrek gives Fiona the "gourd" bottle and she places a nipple
            on it. Two ogre babies crawl up onto Fiona's lap.

                            OGRE BABIES
             Da da.

            A third ogre baby appears at Shrek's feet. He bends down to
            pick him up.

            One big happy family of five. Shrek laughs and gives the
            babies and Fiona a hug.

            The front door opens up to reveal Puss and Donkey.

                            DONKEY
             Hey! I smell Shrek Jr.

            The Dronkeys come swarming in behind Donkey. Dragon peers in
            through the door.

            Shrek with a safety pin in his mouth is doing his best at
            changing diapers. He twists the diaper around and the baby
            goes flying off screen and lands in a diaper that Fiona is
            holding. She smiles at Shrek.

            The swamp house is overrun with Dronkeys, ogre babies and
            dirty diapers.

            Puss sits next to an ogre baby that has a pacifier in his
            mouth. He takes the pacifier out of his mouth, shoves it in
            Puss' mouth and gives Puss a big hug. Another baby comes
            crawling into frame and starts to tug on Puss' tail. A tug
            of war ensues.

            The ogre babies are bathing in a pot of water (a la a beat
            from the Nightmare scene). One of the babies farts in the
            water as Shrek comes in and scoops them up. Shrek laughs.



            Donkey is playing "peek-a-boo" with his ears. A baby ogre
            laughs.
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 117.



                            DONKEY
             Peek-a-boo. Peek-a-boo.

            A baby ogre pulls ear wax from Shrek's ear. The baby uses
            the wax to draw squiggly lines on a piece of paper.

                            QUEEN
             Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy boy.

            The Queen is bouncing a baby ogre on her lap. The baby pukes
            and the Queen smiles.

            There is a knock at the door. Donkey is laying on the floor
            holding a bottle with all four hooves, drinking the milk.

            Shrek grabs the bottle out of Donkey's mouth.

                            DONKEY
             Hey.

            Shrek opens the front door to reveal the Dwarf.

                            NANNY DWARF
             Where's the baby?

            Shrek puts a bottle into the Dwarf's mouth and slams the
            door.

            EXT. SWAMP HOUSE - DAY

            Fiona slides one of the babies down a "slip `n slide" made
            out of mud shot from geysers. Shrek slides down himself.
            The babies scramble out of the way as Shrek slides by,
            spraying mud everywhere.

            baby and Shrek holds up an unhappy, diapered Puss.

            Shrek grabs a gourd bottle off of a shelf. He tosses it to
            Fiona.

            Fiona stands holding one baby over her shoulder. She catches
            the gourd thrown to her, twirls it around (a la Tom Cruise in
            Cocktail), lifts up her leg where another baby is perched on
            her foot and puts the gourd in the baby's mouth.

            Shrek is burping a baby over his shoulder. The baby burps.
            Fiona has a baby over her shoulder and the baby burps. A
            Dronkey sitting on a chair does a flame-belch and an ogre
            baby crawling by farts which causes a flame thrower effect
            into the fireplace.

            Shrek and Fiona tuck all the babies into bed.

</p>
<p>Once upon a time, a long time ago,
a king and queen had a
beautiful daughter named Fiona.
But she was possessed
by a terrible curse.
By day, a lovely princess.
By night, a hideous ogre.
Only true love's kiss
could lift her curse.
So Fiona waited in a tower,
guarded by a dragon, until the day
when her true love would arrive.
But as the days turned into years,
the King and Queen were forced
to resort to more desperate measures.
Whoa, there.
I don't know about this, Lillian.
Fairy Godmother said only true love's
kiss could break Fiona's curse.
I don't trust that woman, Harold.
This may be our last hope.
Besides, he does come
highly recommended by King Midas.
But to put our daughter's life
in the hands of this... person?
He's devious.
He's deceitful. He's, he's...
Rumpelstiltskin!
Mrs. Highness.
How do you do?
Down, Fifi. Get down!
As you can see, everything's in order.
So you'll put an end
to our daughter's curse?
And, in return, you sign the kingdom
of Far Far Away over to me.
- Lillian, this is madness!
- What choice do we have?
Fiona has been locked away
in that tower far too long.
It's not like she's getting any younger.
But to sign over our entire kingdom?
Well, if your kingdom's worth
more to you than your daughter...
Nothing is worth more to us
than our daughter.
Jump, Fifi, jump!
Just sign it and all your problems
will disappear.
Your Highness! The Princess!
She's been saved!
Who saved her?
No one would have guessed
that an ogre named Shrek,
whose roar was feared
throughout the land,
would save the beautiful Princess Fiona.
True love's kiss led to marriage
and ogre babies!
The kingdom of Far Far Away
was finally at peace.
Goody for them!
And they lived happily ever after!
Sir? You're gonna
have to pay for that.
Maybe we could make a deal
for it, little boy?
- Oh, I'm not a real boy.
- Do you want to be?
Nobody needs your deals
anymore, Grumpel Stinkypants!
I wish that ogre was never born!
Wake up, Daddy, wake up!
- Good morning.
- Good morning to you.
Better out than in.
That's my line.
Did my little Fergus make a...
...big, grownup ogre stink?!
Oh, that's diabolical!
And on your left, the lovable lug
that showed us you don't have to
change your undies
to change the world!
I wonder what Shrek's up to in there.
Get in there. Get...
Impossible to put on!
OK, the dragon goes under the bridge,
through the loop...
...and finally, into the castle.
Play date!
Then Shrek kissed the Princess.
She turned into a beautiful ogre
and they lived...
Happily...
- Ever...
- After.
Look! A shooting star!
So, what did you wish for?
That every day could be like this one.
Come here, you.
Morning, Daddy.
Morning.
Better out than in.
Did my little Fergus make a...
Cute. Real cute.
This lovable lug taught us
you don't have to change
your undies to change the world!
Play date!
Shrek! The outhouse is clogged up!
She turned into a beautiful ogre
and they lived...
- Happily...
- Ever...
After?
- Daddy, get up!
- Morning.
- Better out than in.
- This lovable lug...
- Play date!
- No!
Outhouse again!
Come on.
Undies!
Outhouse!
- Get up, get up!
- And they lived...
- Happily...
- Ever...
After.
Roar.
Nice landing, baby.
Hey! Now remember, don't eat the valet.
Happy birthday, nios!
Vamos a la fiesta!
Hey, Shrek, Shrek!
Mr. Shrek, would you
sign our pitchforks?
And our torches?
Oh, man, you used to be so fierce!
Yeah, when you were a real ogre!
A real ogre?
Shrek, it's a sing-along.
You've got to sing along!
- No, thanks.
- Please? I'll be your best friend.
Why does being your best friend entail
me doing everything I don't want to do?
Please, Felicia, not in Daddy's ear.
Excuse me, Mr. Shrek?
Could you do that
ogre roar of yours for my son?
He's a big, big fan.
Do the roar.
You know, I'd rather not.
It's my kids' birthday party.
- Do the roar.
- Honey?
Why don't you go check on the cake?
- Sure.
- And don't forget the candles.
Hold still.
Thanks for the pants, Muffin Man.
I always wanted chaps!
Yee-haw! Giddy up!
- Monsieur Shrek.
- Howdy, Shrek!
Your cake. Voil!
- What is that supposed to be?
- That's Sprinkles the Ogre!
Isn't he cute? He looks just like you.
But happy. It's a party, Shrek.
You gotta cheer up!
I'm in a great mood, actually.
- Oh, I'm gonna lick me a rainbow!
- Donkey!
As long as you're not doing anything,
how about one of those
famous Shrek roars?
- Do the roar.
- Let me set you straight, Butter Pants.
An ogre only roars when he's angry.
You don't want to see me angry, do you?
Do it.
Hold it together. Just hold it together.
Daddy, he's getting away. Do something.
Oh, good.
- What happened to the cake?
- Trust me. It's an improvement.
- You licked it!
- No.
Just because you're an ogre,
doesn't mean you have to eat like one.
Looks like you forgot the candles!
OK, just watch the cake.
I'll go get them.
Watch the cake?
- Where's the cake?!
- We ate the cake.
- Ya.
- What?
No, don't cry.
Hey! I believe you
promised my son a roar.
- Do the roar.
- Roar.
- I don't like it.
- Pigs, we need another cake.
- We ate the other cakes.
- One roar, man.
Hey, everybody!
Shrek's gonna do his famous ogre roar!
Not now, Donkey.
Pigs, are there any cupcakes?
- We ate them, too.
- They have lollipops.
No, I ate them.
- You didn't share?
- Well, you didn't share the croissants!
- Everything's gonna be OK.
- Shrek, what's going on?
- Come on, Shrek, your fans are waiting!
- Do the roar.
We need the cake!
Cake! Cake! Cake!
I love you, Daddy.
Everybody, I have found another cake!
Shrek? Are you OK?
- Unbelievable.
- Tell me about it! Those villagers...
I'm not talking about the villagers,
Shrek. I'm talking about you.
Is this really how you want
to remember the kids' first birthday?
- Oh, great. So this is all my fault?
- Yes. But you know what?
Let's talk about this
after the party, at home.
You mean that roadside
attraction we live in?
Step right up! See the dancing ogre!
Don't worry! He won't bite!
I used to be an ogre.
Now I'm just a jolly green joke!
OK, OK, maybe you're not
the ogre you used to be.
But maybe that's not such a bad thing.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
It's not like you're a real ogre.
You spent half your life in a palace.
And the other half
locked away in a tower.
Look, all I want is for things to go
back to the way they used to be!
Back when villagers were afraid of me,
and I could take a mud bath in peace.
When I could do what I wanted,
when I wanted to do it!
Back when the world made sense!
You mean back before you
rescued me from the Dragon's Keep?
Exactly!
Shrek, you have
three beautiful children,
a wife who loves you,
friends who adore you.
You have everything.
Why is it the only person
who can't see that is you?
That's just great.
If she thinks I'm gonna
slink back there and apologize,
she's got another thing coming.
She's not the boss of me.
I'm an ogre and I'm not gonna apologize
for acting like one.
Help, please!
Someone, anyone at all, help me!
Please, help!
Please, help!
I'm stuck! Help!
Oh, please, help!
Someone, anyone! Help me!
The pain! I can see
a bright light. A tunnel!
Grandma? Is that you?
Yeah, it's me, Granny.
An ogre! Please, Mr. Ogre,
please don't eat me!
I'm not gonna eat you.
But you are an ogre... Aren't you?
Yeah, well, I... I used to be.
Look, move out or get crushed.
So you're not gonna eat me?
No, thanks. I already had a big bowl
of curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.
Wait up! What's your rush?
Where you going?
Nowhere.
What a coincidence!
I was just heading that way myself.
But, seriously,
let me give you a ride. I insist.
Come on. It's the least I can do
after all you've done for me.
I got a hot rat cooking.
All right! Can I interest you
in a mudslide? Slug and tonic?
A liquid libation
to ease that frustration?
- Eyeball-tini?
- Well, maybe just one.
So the centaur says,
"That's not the half I'm talking about. "
I gotta say, Shrek, I envy you.
To live the life of an ogre...
no worries, no responsibilities.
You are free to pillage
and terrorize as you please.
- Free? That's a laugh.
- Oh, yeah?
Sometimes I wish I had just one day
to feel like a real ogre again.
Why didn't you say so?
Magical transactions are my specialty!
Great. Next to mimes,
magicians are my favourite people.
Hold on.
"King for a Month. "
"Knight for a Week. "
Ogre for a day.
Think about it, Shrek.
To be feared and hated.
You'll be, like, "Roar!"
And the villagers will be, like, "Get
away! It's Shrek! I'm so scared of him!"
It would be just like the good old days,
when your swamp was your castle.
- When the world made sense.
- All right, what's the catch?
Catch? No. There's no catch.
No catchings, really.
I mean, there's something.
Small thing. Nothing. A little thing.
All right, I knew it.
So what do you want?
- A day.
- A day.
Rat's done!
To make the magic work, you gotta
give something to get something.
In this case, you gotta
give a day to get a day. That's all.
I can't just pick up
and leave my family.
But that's the best part, Shrek!
It's a magical contract.
No one will even know you're gone.
And by the time this day is up,
you are gonna feel like a changed ogre.
Still, I don't know.
Hey, no problem.
Forget it, no big D. Doesn't matter.
Do you like white meat or dark meat?
So what day would I have to give up?
I don't know, any day.
A day from your past.
A day you had the flu?
A day you lost a pet?
A day some meddling oaf
stuck his nose where it didn't belong
destroying your business
and ruining your life?!
Just for an example.
How about the day I met Donkey?
Now, there's a day
I'd like to take back.
I don't know who that is.
I know. What about a day
you wouldn't even remember?
Like a day when you were a baby.
- An innocent, mindless little baby.
- Take any of those days you want.
- Take them all for all I care.
- Oh, just one will do.
OK, good.
A day from your childhood it is.
I guess there's nothing wrong
with wanting a little time for myself.
Just 24 tiny little hours.
- I'm still my own ogre!
- Yeah, you is!
I never needed to ask
for anyone's permission before.
So why start now?
Go on, Shrek.
Sign it!
Go on, Shrek.
Sign it, Shrek! Sign it!
You signed it.
So, tell me. What happens now?
Have a nice day.
I think I fell on my keys.
There are 40 children in that shoe,
which is why the weasel
goes pop to this very day.
Oh, great.
As we head over the river
and through the woods...
Ogre!
Kill the ogre! Kill the ogre!
This is the part where you run away!
Sure is great to be wanted again.
Nice one.
Fiona?
Oh, no.
My home.
Fiona!
Fiona! Are you in there?!
All right, Rumpel!
This wasn't part of the deal!
Rumpel!
Ogre!
We've got another one, ladies! Get him!
Who are you?!
What are you doing in my swamp?
Looks like a troublemaker!
Spread 'em!
Nice job, ladies!
You witches are making a big mistake!
I know my rights!
You have the right to shut your mouth!
Donkey, stop with the singing, will you?
Donkey!
Donkey, where am I? What's happening?
Quiet down there! Oh, I hate this song.
I'm driving,
so I'm in charge of the music.
Will you witches make up your mind?
Donkey? What's going on?
Do you know where Fiona is?
Quiet, ogre! You're gonna get me
in trouble and I need this job.
I am not going back to work
for Old MacDonald.
Tell me to E-I-E-I-O.
"E-I-E-I-No!" That's what I said.
Where are my babies?
And where's your wife, Dragon?
Look, I think you have me confused
with some other talking donkey.
I've never seen you before in my life.
Never seen me before?
Come on, Donkey!
And how do you
know my name anyway?
It's me, Shrek. Your best friend?
A donkey and an ogre friends?
That's the most
ridiculous thing I ever heard!
Can you at least tell me
where they're taking me?
To the same place they take
every ogre. To Rumpelstiltskin.
- Stiltskin!
- I said quiet!
Oh, no.
It's time to crumble!
Place your bets!
Place your bets! We start tout de suite!
Yeah!
Gingy?
Gingy snap!
There's one!
Disgusting, filthy ogre!
Hideous monster!
Filthy, filthy creature!
Disgusting creature!
Move it!
Don't worry, Donkey.
I'll get us our lives back.
Yeah, right. Put a little mustard
on mine, Captain Crazy!
Mr. Stiltskin?
You got another customer.
- Wolfie!
- Yes, Mr. Stiltskin.
Bring me my business wig.
Mr. Stiltskin, please!
- OK, go.
- Please make me a real boy!
Go away! Terms are
in the details, balsa boy.
Sayonara, termites! Hello, acne!
Stiltskin!
Shrek!
There he is!
So close!
Have I been waiting for you!
Ladies, this is the guy
that made all of this possible!
So, tell me, how are you
enjoying your day?
All right, Rumpel, what's going on?
What have you done?
No, Shrek, it's not what I've done.
It's what you've done.
Thanks to you, the King and Queen
signed their kingdom over to me.
They would never do that.
They would if I promised them
all their problems would disappear.
And then they disappeared!
They would have done anything
if they thought it would
end their daughter's curse.
I ended Fiona's curse!
How could you when you never existed?
You better start making sense,
you dirty little man!
Here, let me spell it out for you!
You gave me a day from your past,
a day you couldn't even remember.
A day when you were
an innocent, mindless little baby.
You took the day I was born.
No, Shrek. You gave it to me.
Enjoy this while you can, Stiltskin,
because when this day is up...
But you haven't heard the best part.
Since you were never born, once
this day comes to an end, so will you.
Where's Fiona?
Where's my family?
Silly little ogre.
You don't get it, do you?
You see, you were never born.
You never met Fiona.
Your kids don't exist.
How's that for a metaphysical paradox?
Looks like you got
exactly what you wanted!
- Happy Ogre Day!
- Rumpel!
Get him, witches!
You know what'd help morale
around here? Flip-flop Fridays.
Feet be comfortable
with the breeze on your toes.
Come on, girls!
Lock all the doors,
you worthless witches! Do it!
I'll be right back, Donkey!
I don't know you! I don't know him!
I'm glad I'm not you.
Help me! Help!
Help!
No, not my pretty ball!
Watch out!
Wolfie?
My angry wig.
Help! I've been kidnapped
by a deranged, unbalanced ogre!
Donkey! Get off of me!
Watch it with your pointy hooves!
- Just take my wallet!
- Hey!
I'm being ass-napped!
Animal cruelty! Help!
You need to calm down!
I'm your friend.
I'm not gonna hurt you, all right?
Good. I'm gonna let go...
...right... now.
Please! Eat my face last!
Send my hooves to my mama!
Donkey! You've got to trust me.
- Why should I trust you?
- Because...
Because...
OK.
Fine! Go ahead!
Run away! Who needs you?
I've never seen an ogre cry.
I'm not crying.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I cry all the time.
Just thinking about my grandma,
or thinking about baby kittens,
or my grandma kissing a baby kitten,
or a little baby grandma kitten.
- That is so darn sad.
- I said, I'm not crying!
Take it easy, I'm only trying to help.
It's none of my business
why you're upset.
By the way, why are you upset?
I was tricked into signing something
I shouldn't have.
You signed up for one of them
time-shares, huh?
No. I signed this.
You should never sign a contract
with Rumpelstiltskin!
Yeah, I got that.
- His fine print is crafty.
- I know.
- His exit clauses are sneaky.
- Yeah, I...
- What did you say?
- I'm talking about the exit clause.
Used to be, you had to guess his name,
but now everybody knows
who Rumpelstiltskin is.
Donkey, I've read the fine print.
There's nothing
about an exit clause in here.
Well, you didn't expect him
to make it easy for you.
Here, let me show you how it's done.
I didn't spend all that time
around them witches
without picking up a few tricks.
Your tiny, little ogre brain
couldn't begin to comprehend
the complexity
of my polygonic foldability skills.
What are you doing?
Hey, I can't get my origami on
unless you back off.
Thank you. OK, here's what you
gotta do. You fold this piece here,
make this letter match up here,
bring this corner here,
and if you do it just right,
it will show you what to do. There!
"Try Lou's Bliss. "
Who's Lou?
Give me that!
"True Love's Kiss. "
You have to take me to dinner first.
"According to fairy tale law,
if not fully satisfied,
true love's kiss will render
this contract null and void. "
Donkey, you did it! Look at you!
If Fiona and I share true love's kiss,
I will get my life back!
OK! This isn't a petting zoo!
So where is this Fiona?
Well, that's just it, you see.
I don't know.
You know, when I lose something,
I always try to retrace my steps.
So... where did you leave her last?
The last time I saw her,
I told her I wished
I'd never rescued her.
- Oh, no.
- Shrek?
Shrek! Shrek, wait! Wait, Shrek!
What, are you crazy?
That's the Dragon's Keep!
They keep dragons in there!
OK, yeah, fine! Go ahead!
I'm gonna just hang back here
and find us some breakfast!
Fiona!
Oh, no.
If I didn't save Fiona...
...then who did?
This is the favour Fiona was
supposed to give me on the day we met.
It's a symbol of our love.
Now smell it!
Hey, man, get that dirty
favour out of my face!
Your nose is the only chance
I have of tracking down my wife,
so stop complaining and start smelling.
Smell it! Get it! Away you go, girl!
Do I look like a bloodhound to you?
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a donkey, not a dog!
If I was a dog, they'd call me Dog,
not Donkey!
And another thing...
Wait a minute.
I think I got something.
- Whatever it is, it's sweet.
- Fiona.
Luscious and tasty.
Hey! That's my wife
you're talking about.
Donkey!
Yeah! Waffles!
And I thought the Waffle Fairy
was just a bedtime story.
Sticky stacks of golden,
syrupy deliciousness!
Donkey! Don't eat that!
There's a stack of freshly made waffles
in the middle of the forest.
Don't you find that
a wee bit suspicious?
Oh, you... I'm just... What are you...?
Bad Donkey! Mustn't.
I said, don't! Don't!
No! Get away from it.
You did.
Look out!
Donkey!
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.
Donkey.
Help! Help me!
Help, Shrek! Help!
Watch your head.
Hey, it's a new guy!
Look at him, all dressed up
in his Sunday vest.
He's really tiny, isn't he?
Yeah. Fate has delivered us
a comrade-in-arms
and for that, we are thankful.
Suit him up!
- Let's go, greenie.
- Now, wait a minute!
- Hey!
- Here you go.
- Welcome to the resistance.
- Resistance?
We fight for freedom
and ogres everywhere!
I didn't know we could do that.
Help! You can't eat me! I got the mange!
- I'm poisonous! I'm all poi...
- I'll take him! This order's to go.
Hey! I haven't removed his giblets yet.
Trust me, you don't want
to eat this one.
I go down smooth,
but come out fighting!
- Let go!
- Don't make Mama mad.
Your dinner is my friend!
- Come on, guys!
- I got to get the giblets out!
- She's back.
- There she is.
Fiona!
I'm so happy I found you!
Maybe you missed orientation,
but for future reference,
personal space is very important to me.
You don't know who I am, do you?
No.
Brogan, I have news from Far Far Away.
Gather the others
and meet me in the war room.
Gretched, make sure everyone
is prepared to move out tonight.
- I need to talk to you.
- What is it?
OK, I know you don't
remember me, but...
...we're married. Hear me out.
And at the birthday party
with some pigs and a puppet,
the villagers wanted me
to sign their pitchforks,
and this boy kept saying,
"Do the roar. "
Then I punched the cakes that the
pigs ate and the next thing I knew,
my donkey fell in your waffle hole.
Right? Who's with me?
I guess I must have kicked him
harder than I thought.
Fiona, I need to...
Witches! All right, everyone,
you know the drill!
- Fiona!
- Witches! Oh, no!
- Witches! Witches!
- Come on, now.
Fiona, that's the third patrol today.
We can't hide forever.
Trust me, Brogan.
After tonight, we won't have to.
- That's your wife?
- That's my wife.
Well, I see who wears the chain mail
in your family!
Some people like to look
at the goblet as... as half empty.
Me, I like to look at it as half full.
We've gone from the bottom
to the top, ladies.
But we're not just an empire.
We're a family.
Everyone has got their cupcake?
Cupcake, cupcake? Good. Yes? Baba?
Good.
Yeah, you know, we have
put away a lot of ogres.
And so one got away.
Who cares? It's not a big deal.
It doesn't matter to me.
It's not like it's the end of the world.
Except... funny thing.
Now that I think about it,
the ogre who got away is Shrek!
And if he shares a kiss
with Fiona by sunrise,
it is the end of the world! Our world!
My empire!
But, as I was saying,
I like to look at the goblet
as half full.
Yelling makes me so parched.
Would anyone care for some water?
Wet your whistle?
A clear, crisp, delicious glass...
...of agua purificada?
Anybody's thirsty?
Nobody's thirsty? No?
Well, then does anyone care to tell me
what it's going to take
to get this ogre? You.
Faster brooms?
- No!
- Pointier hats?
- No! You!
- Maybe we could hire
a professional bounty hunter?
What a world! What a world!
You know, actually
not a bad idea. Baba!
I need a bounty hunter.
And if music doth
soothe the savage beast...
...then I think I might know
just the person!
Listen up, everyone.
Word has come from Far Far Away.
Stiltskin is leading
tonight's ogre hunt himself.
- He's never done that before.
- What? Why?
I bet that's because of us.
If that cupcake-eating clown
finally leaves the safety
of his filthy witch nest...
...he'll be vulnerable.
The plan's simple.
If they follow the usual patrol route,
they'll reach the river by midnight.
We'll be concealed along this road,
waiting for his caravan.
Once they reach the clearing,
I'll give the signal.
And then we attack!
And when the smoke clears...
Wait, what's this?
That's my chimichanga stand.
No, Cookie. We won't be needing that.
Trust me, Fiona. Y'all gonna be
really hungry after this ambush, OK?
Go and finish your little speech.
All right, as I was saying,
when the smoke clears,
Rumpelstiltskin is gone
and the chimichangas have been eaten.
Far Far Away will finally be free.
- And so will we.
- Spread the word.
We move out as soon as
Rumpel leaves the palace.
- Man, this is serious!
- Tell me about it.
How am I ever gonna
get her to kiss me before sunrise?
Actually, I was talking
about the revolution.
Revolution?
Why don't you just
tell her what you told me?
About how you're her true love and
you came from an alternate universe.
Well, while I'm at it,
why don't I tell her
that you're married
to a fire-breathing dragon
and you have little, mutant
donkey-dragon babies.
I do?!
You saw what happened.
She's gonna think I'm crazy.
I'm a daddy?
You know what?
If I got Fiona to kiss me once...
...then I can do it again.
Shrek, do my babies
have hooves or talons?
Donkey...!
Hello?
Fiona?
You should not be here, seor.
Puss?
You've gotta be kidding me.
Feed me, if you dare.
Puss, what happened to you?
You got so fa...
...fancy.
- Do I know you?
Well, where's your hat?
Where's your belt?
Your wee little boots?
Boots? For a cat? Ha!
But you're Puss in Boots.
Maybe once.
But that is a name I have outgrown.
That's not the only thing
you've outgrown.
Hey! I may have let myself go
a little since retirement,
but hanging up my sword
was the best decision of my life.
I have all the cream I can drink
and all the mice I can chase.
I'll get him later.
Puss, what have I done to you?
You've gone soft.
Well, I do get brushed twice a day.
Look, it's not too late to fix it.
All you have to do is help me
get a kiss from Fiona.
What are you doing?
Can I help you with something?
Well, I know how stressful
mounting a rebellion can be...
...rallying the troops,
planning attacks,
so I brought you a little something
to ease the tension.
A gift basket?
You're welcome.
So let's see what you got.
Heart-shaped box of slugs.
Skunk-scented candle.
- Look, this really isn't the...
- What's this? Coupons!
Let's see,
"Good for one free foot massage. "
"A mud facial!"
Oh, and here's one...
"Good for one free kiss. "
Let's cash it now.
Look, I don't know
what this is all about,
but I'm trying to run a revolution.
So unless you have
Rumpelstiltskin's head in there,
I suggest you take your gift basket,
get out of my tent
and go make yourself useful!
Wow. You're right. I am sorry.
I was just trying to be friendly.
No hard feelings?
An apologetic hug?
And a quick kiss goodbye.
Hey!
Wait! Is that mistletoe I see?
Hey, Shrek! Are my babies cute, or do
they make people feel uncomfortable?
- Where'd we find that guy?
- Could it be true?
Have the years of prim
and pampery made me soft?
Don't be silly.
Now who's a pretty kitty?
I am.
Daddy thinks you look real nice, Fifi.
Honk.
All right, Piggies, be gone!
Don't forget to take
her little potty box with you.
This little piggy wants to go home!
- Mr. Stiltskin! He's here.
- Nice.
Pied Piper. How was your commute?
Good.
You call this guy a bounty hunter?
What's he gonna do,
flute those ogres a lullaby?
OK, got it!
Make it stop!
All right, that's enough.
Looks like it's time to pay the piper.
Griselda, seriously,
it's time to pay the piper.
Now go get my cheque book!
Go! Move! Get out!
Things are getting
real sloppy around here!
Here, now make sure they eat up!
You can't end tyranny on
an empty stomach! Go on! Go!
Din-din!
- Come on, Donkey.
- One more time, please?
All right, but this is the last time.
Here it comes. Look at him.
I see you!
That's quite a friend you've got there.
I can see why you haven't eaten him.
Donkey! I hate to pull you away
from your adoring public,
but I'm not getting anywhere with Fiona.
- I need your help!
- Hey, everybody. Who wants dessert?
- Where'd you get these?
- Fiona's garbage.
Just another gift from some
clueless lover boy.
That's a good one, Cookie!
Anyone who knows Fiona knows
this stuff ain't gonna work on her.
Works on me.
Donkey, what am I gonna do?
It's like I don't even know her.
You in trouble, Romeo. The only thing
Fiona cares about is her cause.
- To the cause!
- To the cause!
All right!
Hello!
- Nice moves.
- What are you doing?
What does it look like?
I'm getting ready for ambush action.
Oh, yeah.
I always like to quad my lutes
and do some scrunches
before an operational... op.
This one taken?
We use that to clean the toilets.
And we use that one to clean
the thing we clean the toilets with.
I knew that.
There you go, chief.
Hey... Scott?
My name is Shrek, actually.
You're going to get yourself killed
at the ambush tonight.
I'll be fine.
I think I can take care of myself...
Well, let's see about that.
Hey! Hey... Hey!
What the...?
Fiona?
I got it.
Give me your hand.
The dragon goes under the bridge,
through the loop and finally...
Into the castle.
Wow.
OK. Good.
It seems like you can handle yourself.
- But, Fiona...
- Go get ready for the mission!
- I will, but Fiona...
- That's an order!
All right, let's get those axes
sharpened and weapons packed!
Preparation is half the battle!
Ogre! Un momento! Un momento!
Ogre, ogre, un momento!
Just give me a minute.
Look, Puss, I'm a little
pressed for time.
I am not believing
what I have just witnessed.
Back there, you and Fiona.
There was a spark...
a spark inside her heart
I thought was long extinguished.
It was as if, for one moment,
Fiona had actually found her true love!
I am her true love. I ended her curse.
You know of her curse?
By day, one way, by night another.
This shall be the norm.
Until you find true love's first kiss...
...and then take love's true form.
You even know the little rhyme!
It is true! You are the one!
You must prove it to her!
- How?
- Convince her!
Go to her when she is alone
and tell her something
that only her true love would know.
Know about what?!
Whoa! That's a whole lot of kitty!
Shrek, can we keep him?
Excuse me. Coming through!
Pardon me, guys! Watch your back.
Look, Donkey,
the chimichanga cart! Quick!
ndale! After him, burro!
Donkey, vmonos!
Man, you are a cat-astrophe!
And you are ri-donkey-lous!
I'll scout ahead. Wait for my signal.
Secure your positions!
- It's quite a view from up here.
- What are you doing?!
Get back in position!
You need to know,
once and for all, who I really am.
You are going to ruin everything!
Ruin everything?
Actually, I'm gonna fix everything...
The ogres, Rumpel, your curse.
How do you know about my curse?!
OK, OK, please, Fiona...
Just hear me out.
I can explain everything.
- Where's Fiona's signal?
- What's she waiting for?
- He's going to get away!
- No, he's not.
Listen, I don't know who you are
or how you know about my curse,
but if any of these ogres
find out I'm...
- A beautiful princess?
- That is not who I am! Not anymore.
- Look, I know you're upset.
- You don't know anything about me.
I know everything about you.
I know you sing so beautifully
that birds explode.
- Big deal.
- I know that when you sign your name,
- you put a heart over the "I".
- So what?
I know that when
you see a shooting star,
you cross your fingers on both hands,
squinch up your nose
and you make a wish.
I know that you don't like the covers
wrapped around your feet,
and I know that you sleep by candlelight
because every time
you close your eyes...
...you're afraid you're gonna
wake up back in that tower.
But, most importantly, Fiona...
...I know that the reason
you turn human every day...
...is because you've
never been kissed...
...well...
...by me.
- You move fast.
- It's not me doing the moving.
- Why is this happening?!
- Love?
- No, I'm being forced to dance!
- By love!
No, I can't stop myself!
Please! Make it stop!
I can't control myself!
Yeah! Cookie's bringing
the heat out of the kitchen!
Oh, no! It's the Piper!
I can't believe I let this happen,
and it's all because of you!
- If you'd just let me kiss you!
- What? You're insane!
We must do something before
they fandango themselves into oblivion!
- What can we do?
- First, you must stop dancing!
When somebody tooties that fluty,
I got to shake my booty!
Then it's up to me!
Hurry! We must get them
away from the music!
Puss and Donkey to the rescue!
We saved the day!
Donkey... Can I borrow your tongue?
Say what?!
No. Hell...
I don't care how big your eyes get,
player, it's not going down.
All right!
Stop!
- Where are you going?
- To save my friends.
- How, by getting yourself killed?
- If that's what it takes.
Puss, say something.
- Puss?
- Let me explain.
That's how you knew so much about me.
- Fiona, wait! Kiss me.
- What?
It's the only way to save your friends.
Get out of my way.
You used to believe that a single kiss
could solve everything!
I don't understand.
This doesn't make any sense.
True love's kiss
was supposed to fix everything!
Yeah, you know,
that's what they told me, too.
True love didn't get me
out of that tower.
I did. I saved myself.
Don't you get it?
It's all just a big fairy tale.
Fiona, don't say that. It does exist!
How would you know?
Did you grow up locked away
in a dragon's keep?
Did you live all alone
in a miserable tower?
Did you cry yourself
to sleep every night,
waiting for a true love
that never came?!
But... But I'm your true love.
Then where were you
when I needed you?
Maybe you kissed her wrong?
No.
The kiss didn't work...
...because Fiona doesn't love me.
Don't despair, fellow ogres!
They can put us in cages,
but they can't cage our honour!
Shrek and Fiona are together?!
Yeah, I've heard enough of
your toot-a-lee-toots! You blew it!
Wolfie! My speech wig.
Baba! Ready my makeup.
And Piper, pull my socks up.
- Tight.
- Attention, citizens.
Please stay tuned for a message
from our tyrannical dictator!
Hello, people.
It is I, Rumpelstiltskin...
...shepherd of your dreams.
Recently, a certain somebody
has jeopardized our joyous lives.
And that somebody
is the rat-munching ogre called Shrek!
That is why I come to you,
dear citizens.
For whomever brings me this ogre,
shall receive the deal of a lifetime.
Just think of it! Total and
- complete happiness.
- Ya!
Dazzling, radiant fulfilment!
All your greatest wishes.
- Yeah!
- Your wildest dreams.
Anything you could ever want!
No strings attached!
But hurry, this is a limited time offer.
So light your torches, sharpen
your pitchforks and get your mob on!
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
Go back where you came from!
It seems that we are safe.
Yeah, it looks a lot less pitchforky
and torchy out there. Let's go.
What's the point?
The kiss didn't work. It's over.
Look, Shrek, I know things
might seem a little bleak right now,
but things always work themselves
out in the end, you'll see.
- I bet by this time tomorrow...
- Don't you understand?
There is no tomorrow.
There's no day after that, and there's
no day after that day after that!
My life was perfect
and I'm never going to get it back!
If your life was so perfect, why'd you
sign it away to Rumpelstiltskin?
Because I didn't know
what I had until it was gone! All right?
I didn't know what I had.
Surrender now! I'm taking you in!
Don't try to fight it, ogre!
The reward is mine!
Gingy?
- You unhand me, green devil!
- What are you doing?
Collecting my bounty!
- Bounty?
- What are you talking about, cracker?
Rumpelstiltskin promised
the deal of a lifetime
- for whoever could bring you in.
- Deal of a lifetime?
Where all your wishes come true.
Wait a minute.
- I can still fix this.
- How you gonna do that?
You know what? I'm gonna give
Rumpelstiltskin exactly what he wants.
OK, Gingy, tell me about this...
Were you going to eat that?
Not Shrek. That is not Shrek.
Also not Shrek.
That's not even an ogre,
it is a troll! Nice try.
- And that...
- Roar.
...is just sad.
And what is that supposed to be?
I'm just a frightened old man.
Don't listen to him!
These ogres are crafty!
That is your father painted green.
No, it's Shrek! Honest!
Take them away!
Can no one bring me Shrek?!
Where is he?
How hard can it be?!
I want him! I want him! I want him!
Stiltskin!
I hear you're looking for me.
All right! Finally!
Who turned him in?
Who gets the deal of a lifetime?
- I do.
- What? But...
If I'm turning myself in,
I get the deal of a lifetime.
That means you have
to give me anything I want.
No! Only true love's kiss
can break your contract!
So if you thought you were just gonna...
...in here and get your life back...
- I'm not here to get my life back.
Then what do you want?
The ogres. They are all free.
But where is Shrek?
This is not good.
I don't know.
Not much of a storybook ending.
The noble Shrek turns himself in
to save a bunch of filthy ogres.
All that matters is that they're free...
...and Fiona is safe.
I bet Fiona would be
really touched to hear that.
But, hey...
...I guess you can tell her yourself.
Fiona!
Stiltskin, we had a deal!
You agreed to free all ogres!
Oh, yeah.
But Fiona isn't all ogre, is she?
By day, one way, by night, another.
Blardy, blardy, blar.
Nobody's smart but me!
That was a really brave thing
you did, Shrek.
Thank you.
No, you were right.
I wasn't there for you.
And not just at
the Dragon's Keep, but...
...every day since.
Well...
...you're here now.
Let go of me! I have got to save Shrek!
Don't be a fool, mule!
She's right. Rumpel's palace
is locked up tighter
- than Old Mother Hubbard's Cupboard.
- And that cupboard wasn't guarded
by a whole bunch of
mean, ugly, nasty witches.
Hey! We can hear you!
Sorry!
We must get into the palace.
Man, Shrek and me
just busted out of that place!
But how?
The same way we're gonna bust in.
Yay! My new pretty ball!
Didn't it look bigger in the catalogue?
I guess it'll have to do.
Witches, finally, the moment
we've all been waiting for.
The main event of the evening!
I present Shrek and Fiona!
And now, to put the past
behind us once and for all,
I give you a princess's worst nightmare!
Fiona's old flame,
the keeper of the keep...
...Dragon!
- Donkey?
- And Puss!
In Boots!
Get them, get them, witches!
Incoming!
- Donkey, woo her!
- Woo who?
Your wife!
Uh-oh.
I'll call you! We're in love!
Fiona, hold on!
Hey, you!
- Chimichangas?!
- Get 'em while they're hot!
Jump!
Now!
The dragon goes under the bridge!
Through the loop!
And finally...
Into the castle!
Run!
Foo!
So long!
Come on, Fifi, go!
Go! Witches, close up the floor!
Come on, Fifi, go! Flappity flap!
Come on, go! Fly away! Up, up! Go!
Fifi, no!
Victory is ours!
Looks like we're having
curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.
Hey, we make a pretty good team.
You have no idea.
Shrek?
His day is up. His day is...!
Shrek?
It's all right.
There has to be something I can do.
You've already done
everything for me, Fiona.
You gave me a home and a family.
You have kids?
We have kids.
Fergus, Farkle
and a little girl named...
...Felicia.
- Felicia.
I always wanted to have
a daughter named Felicia.
And someday...
...you will.
You know what the
best part of today was?
I got the chance to fall in love
with you all over again.
Fiona, the sunrise!
You're still... an ogre!
- True love's form.
- Impossible!
The kiss worked.
What?!
Fifi!
Puss!
No, no, no!
No, not yet! I'm not ready! No, wait!
I love you, Daddy!
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
Everybody, I have found another cake!
Shrek? Are you OK?
Fiona. I've never been better.
Roar!
Happy Birthday, Farkle.
Fergus, my little man!
And Felicia, sweetheart.
I believe this is yours.
Thank you, Daddy.
Hey, Uncle Shrek! How about
giving my babies an encore!
Please, seor, let us have it!
- I didn't know we could do that.
- That's my best friend!
You know, I always thought
that I rescued you
from the Dragon's Keep.
You did.
No. It was you that rescued me.
Yummy!</p>

      <footer>What is the GPA?
The GPA is a plurilateral agreement within the framework of the WTO, meaning that not all WTO members are parties to the Agreement. At present, the Agreement has 20 parties comprising 48 WTO members. Another 34 WTO members/observers participate in the GPA Committee as observers. Out of these, 9 members are in the process of acceding to the Agreement.

The fundamental aim of the GPA is to mutually open government procurement markets among its parties. As a result of several rounds of negotiations, the GPA parties have opened procurement activities worth an estimated US$ 1.7 trillion annually to international competition (i.e. to suppliers from GPA parties offering goods, services or construction services).

The GPA is composed mainly of two parts: the text of the Agreement and parties' market access schedules of commitments.

The text of the Agreement establishes rules requiring that open, fair and transparent conditions of competition be ensured in government procurement. However, these rules do not automatically apply to all procurement activities of each party. Rather, the coverage schedules play a critical role in determining whether a procurement activity is covered by the Agreement or not. Only those procurement activities that are carried out by covered entities purchasing listed goods, services or construction services of a value exceeding specified threshold values are covered by the Agreement. These schedules are publicly available here.

As a binding international treaty, the GPA is administered by the Committee on Government Procurement which is composed of representatives of all its parties. The enforcement of the Agreement is realized through two mechanisms: the domestic review mechanism at the national level and the WTO dispute settlement mechanism at the international level.

back to top
Evolution of the GPA
The revised GPA, which entered into force on 6 April 2014, is attracting more and more attention worldwide but liberalizing procurement markets is not a completely new idea. Early efforts to bring government procurement under internationally agreed trade rules were undertaken in the OECD framework. The matter was then brought into the Tokyo Round of Trade Negotiations within GATT in 1976.

As a result, the first agreement on government procurement (the so-called “Tokyo Round Code on Government Procurement”) was signed in 1979 and entered into force in 1981. It was amended in 1987 and the amendment entered into force in 1988. Parties to the agreement then held negotiations to extend the scope and coverage of the agreement in parallel with the Uruguay Round. Finally, a new Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA 1994) was signed in Marrakesh on 15 April 1994 — at the same time as the Agreement Establishing the WTO — and entered into force on 1 January 1996.

Within two years of the implementation of GPA 1994, the GPA parties initiated the renegotiation of the Agreement according to a built-in provision of the 1994 Agreement. The negotiation was concluded in December 2011 and the outcome of the negotiations was formally adopted in March 2012. Instruments of acceptance, often based on the completion of domestic ratification procedures, had to be submitted by two-thirds of the GPA parties in order for the revised Agreement to enter into force 30 days later. This requirement was fulfilled on 7 February 2014, with the tenth instrument of acceptance of the Agreement being deposited by Israel. The revised Agreement consequently entered into force on 6 April 2014.

Parties will continue improving the GPA. The revised GPA clearly sets out that, no later than three years after the entry into force of the revised GPA and periodically thereafter, the parties shall undertake further negotiations to progressively reduce and eliminate discriminatory measures and to achieve the greatest possible extension of the coverage. In this spirit, the GPA parties have also agreed to undertake a number of work programmes which will influence the future evolution of the Agreement.
Generally speaking, the two versions of the Agreement are based on the same principles, i.e. non-discrimination, transparency and procedural fairness, and contain the same main elements:

guarantees of national treatment and non-discrimination for the suppliers of parties to the Agreement with respect to procurement of covered goods, services and construction services as set out in each party's schedules
provisions regarding accession to the Agreement and the availability of special and differential treatment for developing and least-developed countries
detailed procedural requirements regarding the procurement process designed to ensure that covered procurement under the Agreement is carried out in a transparent and competitive manner that does not discriminate against the goods, services or suppliers of other parties
additional requirements regarding transparency of procurement-related information (e.g. relevant statutes and regulations)
provisions regarding modifications and rectifications of parties' coverage commitments
requirements regarding the availability and nature of domestic review procedures for supplier challenges which must be put in place by all parties to the Agreement
provisions regarding the application of the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding in this area
a “built-in agenda” for improvement of the Agreement, extension of coverage and elimination of remaining discriminatory measures through further negotiations.

Improvements in the Revised Agreement
Nonetheless, the revised text improves on the GPA 1994 in a number of ways:

The revised text entails a complete revision of the wording of the various provisions of the Agreement to streamline them and make the text easier to understand.
The revised text takes into account developments in current government procurement practice, notably the use of electronic tools. It sets out related requirements to ensure that the general principles of the GPA are fully respected in the electronic era. It also incorporates additional flexibility for parties' procurement authorities — for example, shorter notice periods when electronic tools are used.
The special and differential treatment provisions (S&D) that are available to developing members acceding to the GPA have been clarified and improved. This is expected to facilitate their accession, thus expanding the membership of the Agreement and market access opportunities.
The revised text introduces a specific new requirement for participating governments and their relevant procuring entities to avoid conflicts of interest and prevent corrupt practices. This signals a belief on the part of the parties that the GPA can play a part in promoting good governance. The revised Agreement is also seen as an important tool for promoting a transparent and relatively corruption-free environment in the economies that are in the process of acceding to the Agreement.
Under the revised GPA, the schedule of each party contains seven annexes:

Annex 1: central government entities
Annex 2: sub-central government entities
Annex 3: other entities
Annex 4: goods
Annex 5: services
Annex 6: construction services
Annex 7: general notes.

The coverage schedules of parties as agreed on 30 March 2012 are set out in document GPA/113. To facilitate the handling of individual parties' schedules and to take into account modifications that have been certified since that date, loose-leaf schedules have been prepared with regard to those parties that have accepted the revised Agreement. These reflect parties' current legal binding coverage commitments.

The integrated Government Procurement Market Access Information Resource (e-GPA) portal of the WTO also provides information on coverage, including on the applicable thresholds, under the Revised GPA.

Coverage schedules under the GPA 1994
Under the GPA 1994, the schedule of each party contains only five annexes:

Annex 1: central government entities
Annex 2: sub-central government entities
Annex 3: other entities
Annex 4: services
Annex 5: construction services
The notes, which are now set out in Annex 7 of the revised GPA are included as “General Notes” under the GPA 1994. In addition, all goods are covered under both versions of the GPA unless specifically exempted. While the GPA 1994 does not have a goods annex, this general rule is contained in a separate goods annex in the revised GPA.
